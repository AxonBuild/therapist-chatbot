Sleep Relaxation Protocol

Take a moment to settle comfortably in a place where you can relax without being disturbed. You might lie down on your bed, on a yoga mat, or simply sit in a chair where you feel supported. The important thing is that your body feels held and relaxed, without needing to maintain any posture. You might want to cover yourself with a light blanket or place a cushion under your head for extra comfort. Once you're well positioned, gently close your eyes if you like, and let your body begin to relax.

Bring your awareness to your breathing. Don’t try to change it — just observe. Feel the air entering your lungs and then flowing out. Each breath is natural and peaceful. Observe the subtle movement of your body as you breathe — perhaps a slight rise in your chest or belly. With every breath, you feel a bit more relaxed, a bit more grounded in the present moment. Imagine that each exhale releases a little more tension, a little more stress. Let every breath guide you deeper into relaxation, helping you ...

Now, imagine that you are standing at the top of a staircase. This staircase is special — it represents a path toward deep relaxation and inner peace. The steps are made of a soft and welcoming material beneath your feet — maybe polished wood, smooth stone, or plush carpet. Every step you take on this staircase is an invitation to relax further. The walls around you are comforting, painted in soothing colors, and the lighting is soft, creating an atmosphere of calm and serenity.

You are now preparing to descend the staircase, one step at a time. With each step down, you feel your body becoming more and more relaxed, heavier, as if you're leaving behind all stress and concerns. You place your foot on the first step. In that moment, you already feel a wave of relaxation washing over you. Each step down draws you deeper into calm and stillness. You feel the heaviness in your muscles, the release in your shoulders, and the spreading relaxation throughout your body.

You continue descending, slowly, step by step. With each one, you feel a bit closer to sleep, a bit more disconnected from the outside world. Your thoughts begin to slow down, drifting away like fog. The only thing that matters now is this sensation of descending — moving toward a state of complete rest. You feel a lightness in your mind, as if every step takes you further away from the day’s tension.

You reach the fifth step. Here, a deep sense of calm envelops you. It's as if your entire body lets go even more. You no longer need to make any effort — gravity itself seems to gently pull you downward, toward this state of deep relaxation. You continue down, and with each step, you feel increasingly relaxed, as if carried by a soft, gentle force guiding you toward complete rest.

At the tenth step, you are now fully immersed in this sensation of calm. Your thoughts are peaceful, your breathing slow and steady. Every part of your body seems to have found a new balance — a place where you can simply be, without doing anything. You are at peace, deeply anchored in this state of descending relaxation.

You keep descending, step by step. Each one brings you closer to deep, restorative sleep. The light around you grows softer, dimmer — creating the perfect atmosphere for rest. You are so deeply relaxed that every movement feels automatic. You’re simply being carried downward. You reach the fifteenth step, where calm transforms into a gentle drowsiness. Your eyelids are heavy — keeping them open feels more and more difficult, even if you try.

Continue going down, taking all the time you need. There's no rush — just a quiet journey into deep rest. You feel your body growing heavier, as if it’s melting into the staircase itself. Every fiber of your being resonates with tranquility. Your thoughts are far away now — like a distant murmur, a soft melody in the background that demands nothing from you.

At the twentieth step, you are almost asleep. The act of descending has become so natural that you don’t even need to think about it anymore. You’re simply carried by this gentle, continuous movement, allowing your body to relax even more deeply. You are now in a state of relaxation so deep that every cell in your body seems bathed in peace — in a sea where everything is calm and serene.

As you continue your descent, you approach the final steps of the staircase. With each step, you feel increasingly overwhelmed by a deep desire to sleep, to completely let go. It’s as if the whole world is fading, leaving only you, the staircase, and this infinite sense of peace. You are now so close to the bottom that you can almost feel the ground — a soft and welcoming place that awaits you.

You finally reach the last step. Here, you are in total peace. There is nothing more you need to do. The desire to sleep is now irresistible — all you want is to close your eyes and let yourself drift into the deep sleep that calls to you. The bottom of the staircase is a place of rest — a sanctuary where you can surrender in complete safety, knowing you are protected, at peace, and ready for sleep.

Take a moment to feel this sense of absolute calm. You’ve arrived at your destination, and this resting place is entirely yours. Let yourself go — allow your body to completely surrender to sleep. You are safe, enveloped by the atmosphere of serenity that surrounds you. The outside world is now far away. You are submerged in a state of such deep relaxation that nothing else exists but this moment of peace.

Your breathing is now so slow and steady that you are on the verge of sleep. You are lying on the floor of this sanctuary — this place of rest made just for you. Every muscle in your body is completely relaxed. Every thought has become a distant echo. You are ready to fall asleep — to sink into the deep, restorative sleep that awaits you.

As you close your eyes, let yourself be carried by this sense of stillness. Sleep comes naturally, effortlessly. And you know that when you wake, you will be completely rested, refreshed, and ready to face a new day. But for now, the only thing that matters is this moment of rest — this moment of total peace where you can simply be, without needing to do anything else.

Let yourself gently slip into sleep, knowing you are safe, at peace, and deeply relaxed. This sleep is yours — a space for regeneration, where you can find the inner calm you need. Good night, and sleep well.
