[Start of Script – Gentle Induction]

This moment is for you.
A moment to let go…
To let the last thoughts of the day drift away…
To let your body rest, like setting down a burden at the foot of the bed.

Take a deep breath in…
And as you exhale, imagine you’re releasing a sigh…
An inner sigh…
A soft wave of relaxation flowing down from the top of your head…
to your shoulders…
to your belly…
to your legs…

And your body can start to unwind, part by part…
As if being cradled… by a slow wave…
that wraps around you…
reassures you…
and guides you toward a calmer space…

[Body Awareness – Belly Relaxation]

Now bring your full attention to your belly…
There’s no need to judge it, no need to analyze.
Just… rest your inner gaze…
on this area that sometimes carries tension…
expectations…
battles…

And if you wish, you can gently place a hand on your belly.
Just to say:
“I’m here with you. I’m not against you.”

Take a deep breath…
And under your hand, you might feel…
a slight movement…
a gentle back-and-forth…
like a forgotten breath… softly returning.

[Emotional Release Suggestion]

Now imagine your belly…
like a lake…
Sometimes peaceful…
Sometimes stirred…
And tonight, you’re helping it return to stillness…

All the thoughts from the day…
All the judgments about your body…
All the “I should have…” or “I shouldn’t have…”
You can lay them beside you, like clothes you no longer need…

You can even picture a box…
into which you place every thought that weighs you down…
every word that hurt you…
every doubt, every tension.

And you close this box.
For tonight.
Because this moment is sacred.
This moment is yours.

[Working with Food-Related Guilt]

Maybe there have been nights when you ate without hunger…
When your body was crying out for rest… but your mind was asking for comfort…
Maybe there were empty evenings…
and that emptiness tried to fill itself… in other ways…

But tonight, you don’t have to fight.
There’s nothing to fix.
You can forgive yourself.
You’re doing the best you can, with what you’re living through.

And your body… the body you sometimes treat harshly…
it simply wants to live.
It just wants to be heard.

You can say to it:
“Thank you for holding on.”
“I’m learning to listen to you differently.”

And as you say this silently…
you might feel a soft release…
a sense of calm…
as if your belly whispered back: “Thank you.”

[Positive Visualization – Nourishing Differently]

Now imagine a place…
A soft, calm space…
Maybe a nighttime garden… bathed in moonlight…
Or a room filled with warm, gentle light…
Or a cocoon, just for you…

In this place, you feel a deep calm.
And you realize that… what you were sometimes seeking in food…
wasn’t flavor.
It was care.
Gentleness.
The permission to exist.

And tonight, you can nourish yourself differently.
Through the warmth of a blanket…
The softness of a breath…
The kindness of your own inner voice.

You don’t need to fill.
You just need to gently inhabit your body.

⸻

[Reinforcing Inner Safety]

In this space, you are safe.
No one is waiting for you, judging you, watching you.
You have nothing to prove.
You can even say to yourself:
“I no longer have to be perfect.”
“I have the right to rest.”

And the more you repeat these words…
the more your nervous system calms…
the more your belly loosens…
And hunger… will return… at the right time,
Not to fill a void…
But to honor a simple need: the need to live.

[Emotional Anchoring Before Sleep]

Now you can imagine a soft light, in your belly…
A light the color of honey…
Gently spinning…
Like a slow star…
And this light wraps around you… protects you… repairs you…

And with each breath, you amplify it…
This light becomes your inner refuge.
A space you can return to…
Each evening…
When the mind tries to convince you that you weren’t “enough”…
When loneliness presses in a little too hard…

You can come back here.

⸻

[Returning or Slipping into Sleep]

In a moment…
You’ll gently drift…
into peaceful sleep…
Or simply remain here… cradled…
in this cocoon of calm and kindness…

You can say to yourself:

“Tonight, I have nothing to prove.”
“I make peace with my body.”
“I deserve rest, even if everything isn’t perfect.”

And as you stay with this sensation of release…
Your unconscious is already…
reprogramming a new connection…
with food…
with yourself…

A gentler connection.
One that takes its time.
One that doesn’t judge.

[Closing Phrase]

“I am at peace tonight. My body can rest. And tomorrow, I will wake up a little freer.”
