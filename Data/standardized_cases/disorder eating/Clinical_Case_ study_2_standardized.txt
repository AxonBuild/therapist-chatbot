# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
Age & Gender: Male, 55  
Status: Business Owner  

## Summary of Issues
Main problems include evening eating disorders characterized by snacking or emotional eating episodes. The patient experiences mental exhaustion due to an overload of responsibilities and a lack of recognition. Other issues identified are harsh self-demand with a constant pursuit of perfection, emotional hypersensitivity masked by control, diffuse guilt, a sense of mismatch between effort and results, resistance to delegation, and feelings of loneliness and intellectual disconnection. This case appears to be related to disordered eating.

## Dominant Emotions
- Frustration
- Mental fatigue
- Repressed anger
- Guilt
- Doubt
- Sense of absurdity

## Triggers and Mechanisms
Chain reaction breakdown:
1. Accumulated fatigue + cognitive overload
2. Perceived lack of recognition / inefficiency of others
3. Activation of a control/duty schema → “I’ll do it myself”
4. Repressed emotional exhaustion → self-comfort through food
5. Post-behavior guilt → reinforcement of the cycle

Psychological and past origins include an inherited demanding parental model, a childhood marked by the need to excel to feel seen, and a retreat into rationalization to protect from emotion.

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I must be flawless to earn my place.”
- “If I don’t do it myself, it will be done poorly.”
- “Being sensitive means being weak.”
- “You can’t succeed without suffering.”

## Proposed Solutions
Immediate solutions:
- Set up an emotional transition ritual between work and evening (e.g., hot shower + 3 minutes of cardiac coherence + anchoring phrase: “I’ve done enough for today.”)
- Keep a journal of emotional “saturations” at the end of the day to note what drained energy and why.
- Create an emotional rescue box with sensory alternatives instead of food (e.g., comforting warm drink, positive voice recording, weighted blanket).

Intermediate solutions:
- Recondition the link between worth and merit by honoring small daily wins (keep a list of “3 things I did well today”).
- Work on control schemas through cognitive coaching or ACT therapy.
- Restructure the day to include “emotional rewards” before the evening (exercise, chosen solitude, moments of pleasure without purpose).

Long-term solutions:
- Hypnosis to defuse the loop: fatigue → compensation → guilt → fatigue.
- Rebuilding a more fluid identity based on authenticity rather than performance.
- Meditation for accepting lack of control and vulnerability.

## Progress Indicators
Indicators to monitor:
- Frequency of emotional snacking
- Perceived fatigue level (morning and evening)
- Self-assessed emotional state (before and after hypnosis sessions)
- Achievement rate of “healthy reward” micro-goals
- Reduction in self-critical inner dialogue
