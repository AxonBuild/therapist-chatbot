## Summary of Issues
- Main reported issue: Evening eating disorders before sleep
- Eating disorders at the end of the day (snacking or emotional eating episodes)
- Mental exhaustion caused by overload of responsibilities and lack of recognition
- Harsh self-demand, with a constant pursuit of perfection and excellence
- Rationalized emotional hypersensitivity, hidden under layers of control

## Dominant Emotions
- Frustration
- Mental fatigue
- Repressed anger
- Guilt
- Doubt
- Sense of absurdity

## Triggers and Mechanisms
- Accumulated fatigue and cognitive overload
- Perceived lack of recognition and inefficiency of others
- Activation of a control/duty schema: “I’ll do it myself”
- Repressed emotional exhaustion leading to self-comfort through food
- Post-behavior guilt reinforcing the cycle
- Psychological and past origins include a demanding parental model, childhood need to excel to feel seen, and retreat into rationalization to protect from emotion

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I must be flawless to earn my place.”
- “If I don’t do it myself, it will be done poorly.”
- “Being sensitive means being weak.”
- “You can’t succeed without suffering.”

## Proposed Solutions
- **Immediate solutions**: Set up an emotional transition ritual between work and evening, keep a journal of emotional saturations, and create an emotional rescue box.
- **Intermediate solutions**: Recondition the link between worth and merit, work on control schemas through cognitive coaching or ACT therapy, and restructure the day to include emotional rewards.
- **Long-term solutions**: Hypnosis to defuse the loop, rebuilding a more fluid identity, and meditation for accepting lack of control and vulnerability.

## Progress Indicators
- Frequency of emotional snacking
- Perceived fatigue level (morning and evening)
- Self-assessed emotional state (before and after hypnosis sessions)
- Achievement rate of “healthy reward” micro-goals
- Reduction in self-critical inner dialogue

## Final Motivational Phrase
“What if excellence no longer meant achieving everything, but daring sometimes to do nothing at all? To dare being human—even when no box is checked. Your value is not measured in results, but in presence. And you are here.”
