1. Demographics
   - Age: 38 years old
   - Gender: Female
   - Occupation: Banker

2. Summary of Issues
   - Chronic hypervigilance: entrenched in a constant state of professional tension, with marked somatic effects such as digestive disorders and eating blocks.
   - Generalized anxiety disorder: constant sense of being “on edge,” persistent mental rumination, loss of pleasure and appetite.
   - Restrictive and anxiety-driven eating disorder (ED): food blockage before meals, fear of eating, loss of physiological hunger, shame during social meals.
   - Toxic work environment: feelings of being manipulated, betrayed, devalued; loss of trust in management; constant psychological struggle.
   - Feelings of illegitimacy, blockage, and helplessness: “I don’t belong there,” yet a sense of being trapped in a context where the body is already on high alert.
   - Loss of self-confidence, gradual disengagement: difficulty setting boundaries, guilt over not “doing things right,” internal resistance.
   - Emotional and physical exhaustion: awareness of a possible physical breakdown if the situation doesn’t change soon.

3. Dominant Emotions
   - Intense anxiety
   - Disgust (toward self, others, food)
   - Shame (in social eating contexts)
   - Frustration and helplessness
   - Repressed anger
   - Sadness from no longer feeling pleasure

4. Triggers and Mechanisms
   - Identified anxiety cycle:
     1. Anticipating work → hypervigilance
     2. Loss of appetite → physical digestive tension
     3. Intrusive thoughts: “I won’t make it / I’ll freeze again”
     4. Attempt at control (fragmented eating, body scanning)
     5. Self-blame: “I’m annoying / complicated”
     6. Stress reinforcement → eating disorder

5. Limiting Beliefs
   - “If I don’t anticipate everything, I lose control.”
   - “I have to hold on, even if it destroys me.”
   - “It’s not up to me to fall apart.”
   - “I’m a burden when I express my needs.”
   - “If I show my weaknesses, I lose legitimacy.”

6. Proposed Solutions
   - Immediate (soothing / reassurance effects)
     • Guided breathing before each meal (3 minutes of cardiac coherence → parasympathetic grounding)
     • “Food permission” exercise: telling yourself, “It’s okay if I don’t finish everything. What matters is feeling at peace with myself.”
     • One-minute grounding: visualize a safe place, a comforting moment before each meal to associate safety with eating.
   - Intermediate (progressive restructuring)
     • Food experience journal: noting emotions and sensations before / during / after meals → helps detach food from anxiety.
     • Compassionate self-dialogue: transform “I’m annoying” into “I’m in an inner struggle, doing my best to protect myself.”
     • Work on fear of losing control: through micro-exposure to unpredictability (e.g., not knowing what’s for lunch once a week).
   - Long-term solutions
     • Targeted hypnosis on toxic vigilance and inner insecurity.
     • Immersive meditation: “Rediscovering the joy of eating in safety.”
     • Symbolic work on professional change: visualization of a door opening toward a space where one can breathe, be respected, and find peace.

7. Progress Indicators
   - Daily self-assessment (anxiety level before meals: scale 0–10)
   - Food pleasure indicator: once a day, note one pleasant thing about eating (even a small detail)
   - Weekly evolution of the feeling of blockage vs. freedom at work
