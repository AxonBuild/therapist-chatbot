Demographics  
Female, 18 years old, student  

Summary of Issues  
The patient is experiencing disorder eating characterized by alternating between strict control and binge eating episodes. She exhibits moral judgments regarding food ('good' vs 'bad'), experiences strong guilt after meals, and feels powerless when her comforting eating routines are disrupted. Additionally, she has a difficult relationship with her body, stemming from childhood body hatred and constant comparison to a very thin friend. Emotional imbalances are present, including academic stress, sleep issues, and emotional hypersensitivity, alongside feelings of family injustice regarding her needs around food. Unstable friendship dynamics further complicate her emotional state, as she navigates a friendship triangle marked by exclusion, jealousy, and unspoken conflicts.  

Dominant Emotions  
Guilt  
Body shame  
Silent anger  
Injustice  
Sadness  
Fear of losing control  

Triggers and Mechanisms  
Main triggers include the disruption of comforting eating routines, social situations involving 'special' food (e.g., pizza, raclette, crepes), perceived family neglect (e.g., no groceries, unequal treatment with her brother), and comparisons with other bodies and metabolisms. Psychological mechanisms involve a typical chain reaction: lack → frustration → loss of control → binge → guilt → desire to restrict → overload → new crisis.  

Limiting Beliefs  
If I eat something special, I lose control.  
I only matter if I control my body.  
I don’t deserve to be considered like others.  
I must manage on my own, even for basic needs.  
A slim and rational friend is better than me.  

Proposed Solutions  
Immediate Solutions (Daily Management)  
- Create an 'emergency food kit': keep a small box of favorite items (chia, agave syrup, almonds, etc.) in your bag or locker to avoid sudden frustration.  
- Kind food journal: track not to control but to observe kindly (What did I enjoy eating today? How did I feel after?).  
- Express anti-crisis exercise: before a binge, pause 3 minutes: 'Am I hungry? Thirsty? Do I need something other than food?' + deep breathing.  

Intermediate Solutions (Deeper Rebalancing)  
- Establish two to three nurturing ritual meals per week with favorite foods, mindfully, without phone or judgment. Set an intention (self-care, reconnection).  
- Cognitive restructuring: change 'I ate badly so I’m worthless' → 'I ate differently than my ideal, but I still deserve love.'  
- Daily soothing visualization: every morning, imagine a meal that calms you. Feel the relaxation, desire, and softness in your body.  

Long-Term Solutions (Transforming Patterns)  
- Body image rebuilding:  
  - Progressive body acceptance through mirror work.  
  - Replace comparisons with positive affirmations rooted in bodily experience.  
- Hypnosis for food reconciliation: Theme – 'Giving My Body a Voice'.  
- Family psychoeducation (if possible): Initiate dialogue with parents about the impact of food choices on your well-being, or create visible spaces for your needs (shared grocery list).
