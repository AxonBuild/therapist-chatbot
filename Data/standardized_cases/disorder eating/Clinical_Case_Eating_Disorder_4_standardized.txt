# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
Female, 18 years old, student

## Summary of Issues
- **Eating Disorders**: Alternating between strict control and binge eating episodes, eating habits loaded with moral judgments ('good' vs 'bad' food'), strong guilt after meals, feeling powerless when comforting eating routines are disrupted.
- **Difficult Relationship with the Body**: Body hatred dating back to childhood, constant comparison (especially with a very thin friend), early labeling ('the greedy one') shaping body identity.
- **Emotional Imbalance**: Academic stress, sleep issues, emotional hypersensitivity, feeling of family injustice (needs around food not acknowledged), need to be seen, acknowledged, and respected in her choices.
- **Unstable Friendship Dynamics**: Friendship triangle with implicit tensions (exclusion, jealousy, unspoken conflicts), seeking emotional balance in a trio perceived as 'perfect' but experienced as unstable.

This case appears to be related to disordered eating.

## Dominant Emotions
Guilt  
Body shame  
Silent anger  
Injustice  
Sadness  
Fear of losing control  

## Triggers and Mechanisms
- **Main Triggers**: Disruption of comforting eating routines, social situations involving 'special' food (pizza, raclette, crepes), perceived family neglect (no groceries, unequal treatment with brother), comparison with other bodies and metabolisms, fatigue, stress, academic overload.
- **Identified Psychological Mechanisms**: Typical chain reaction: Lack → frustration → loss of control → binge → guilt → desire to restrict → overload → new crisis.

## Limiting Beliefs
- If I eat something special, I lose control.
- I only matter if I control my body.
- I don’t deserve to be considered like others.
- I must manage on my own, even for basic needs.
- A slim and rational friend is better than me.
