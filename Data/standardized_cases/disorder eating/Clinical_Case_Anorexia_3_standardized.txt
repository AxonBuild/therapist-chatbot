# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
Female, 22 years old

## Summary of Issues
1. Eating disorder with anorexic predominance:
   - Marked food restriction (skipping lunch, mainly liquid or very low-calorie diet).
   - Avoidance of carbohydrates and rigid eating habits.
   - Intense body preoccupation, frustration linked to weight regain.
   - Unrealistic body goals (thigh gap).
   - Onset of disorder related to an old bereavement.

2. Emotional and cognitive overcontrol:
   - Excessive emotional control (“it’s about control, that’s all”), mental rigidity.
   - Difficulty recognizing emotions (“I’m often annoyed”), undifferentiated anger.
   - Mental overload, rumination, perceived synaptic overactivation.

3. Transgenerational emotional burden and internalized guilt:
   - Internal conflict around parental injunctions (“finish your plate”) and unprocessed family traumas.
   - Identification with the role of the “trash generation” → feeling of inheriting “psychological garbage” + eco-anxiety.

4. Ambivalence towards care:
   - Several previous therapeutic attempts (dieticians), little success.
   - Desire to understand, but significant mental fatigue.
   - Attitude oscillating between lucidity and defensive detachment.

## Dominant Emotions
- Intense frustration
- Silent anger / diffuse irritation
- Unexpressed sadness in the background
- Bodily and existential guilt
- Diffuse fear of losing bodily/physiological control
- Ambivalence about change

## Triggers and Mechanisms
Major trigger: Initial bereavement that destabilized her mental balance and catalyzed the use of food control as a survival strategy.

Mechanism:
- Emotional hypervigilance → cognitive rigidity → restrictive strategies → temporary control reinforcement → increased frustration → internalized anger → maintenance loop of the disorder.

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I must control everything to exist.”
- “If I gain weight, I lose control.”
- “My body betrays me.”
- “Emotions are dangerous or unmanageable.”
- “I carry my parents’ mistakes.”

## Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions
   - Daily emotional self-observation: Anger/frustration/energy scale (0 to 10), morning and evening.
   - Mini body anchor: breathe 4x/day, place a hand on your belly, say inwardly “I am here, my body is alive.”
   - Conscious nutrition: note one pleasure food per week (even a small one) without self-judgment.

2. Intermediate Solutions
   - Strengthen therapeutic alliance with a dietician specialized in EDs, focused on dialogue, not weight.
   - Create an “emotion-food” journal to identify links between emotional state and eating behavior.
   - Cognitive deactivation exercise: “What if I allowed 5% of letting go?” (daily ritual question).

3. Long-Term Solutions
   - Deconstruct control patterns through regular hypnosis.
   - Explore transgenerational traumas and unprocessed grief (therapy, EMDR if open).
   - Guided sessions to restore the body as a place to live rather than to control.

## Progress Indicators
- Week 1: Number of full meals/day - Stabilization at 2 meals, then 3
- Week 2: Anger/frustration scale - Reduction by at least 2 points
- Week 3: Inclusion of a pleasure food - Once/week
- Week 4: Perceived bodily sensations - Gradual return of hunger, pleasure, satiety
- Week 6: Emotional openness - Ability to name 3 emotions during the week
