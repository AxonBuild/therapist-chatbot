# Demographics
Female, 22 years old

# Summary of Issues
1. Eating disorder with anorexic predominance:
   - Marked food restriction (skipping lunch, mainly liquid or very low-calorie diet).
   - Avoidance of carbohydrates and rigid eating habits.
   - Intense body preoccupation, frustration linked to weight regain.
   - Unrealistic body goals (thigh gap).
   - Onset of disorder related to an old bereavement.

2. Emotional and cognitive overcontrol:
   - Excessive emotional control (“it’s about control, that’s all”), mental rigidity.
   - Difficulty recognizing emotions (“I’m often annoyed”), undifferentiated anger.
   - Mental overload, rumination, perceived synaptic overactivation.

3. Transgenerational emotional burden and internalized guilt:
   - Internal conflict around parental injunctions (“finish your plate”) and unprocessed family traumas.
   - Identification with the role of the “trash generation” → feeling of inheriting “psychological garbage” + eco-anxiety.

4. Ambivalence towards care:
   - Several previous therapeutic attempts (dieticians), little success.
   - Desire to understand, but significant mental fatigue.
   - Attitude oscillating between lucidity and defensive detachment.

# Dominant Emotions
- Intense frustration
- Silent anger / diffuse irritation
- Unexpressed sadness in the background
- Bodily and existential guilt
- Diffuse fear of losing bodily/physiological control
- Ambivalence about change

# Triggers and Mechanisms
Major trigger: Initial bereavement that destabilized her mental balance and catalyzed the use of food control as a survival strategy.

Mechanism:
Emotional hypervigilance → cognitive rigidity → restrictive strategies → temporary control reinforcement → increased frustration → internalized anger → maintenance loop of the disorder.

# Limiting Beliefs
- “I must control everything to exist.”
- “If I gain weight, I lose control.”
- “My body betrays me.”
- “Emotions are dangerous or unmanageable.”
- “I carry my parents’ mistakes.”

# Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions
   - Daily emotional self-observation: Anger/frustration/energy scale (0 to 10), morning and evening.
   - Mini body anchor: breathe 4x/day, place a hand on your belly, say inwardly “I am here, my body is alive.”
   - Conscious nutrition: note one pleasure food per week (even a small one) without self-judgment.

2. Intermediate Solutions
   - Strengthen therapeutic alliance with a dietician specialized in EDs, focused on dialogue, not weight.
   - Create an “emotion-food” journal to identify links between emotional state and eating behavior.
   - Cognitive deactivation exercise: “What if I allowed 5% of letting go?” (daily ritual question).

3. Long-Term Solutions
   - Deconstruct control patterns through regular hypnosis.
   - Explore transgenerational traumas and unprocessed grief (therapy, EMDR if open).
   - Guided sessions to restore the body as a place to live rather than to control.

# Final Motivational Sentence
“Your body is not your enemy, it is the first home you’ve ever known. You don’t need to dominate it to exist, only to learn to listen to it again. And that, you can do—one breath at a time.”
