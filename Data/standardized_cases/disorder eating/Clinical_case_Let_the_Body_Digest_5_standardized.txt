Female, 19 years old

# Summary of Issues
- Chronic underlying stress perceived as permanent, with a normalization of emotional discomfort.
- Constant physical and mental fatigue, with no real recovery.
- Episodes of explosive, uncontrollable anger ("color crises") without apparent rational triggers → sudden emotional outbursts often triggered by overload, injustice, or neglect of self.
- Over-responsibility in the romantic relationship, with the impression of having to “do everything alone” and low perceived reciprocity.
- Conflict avoidance: emotional inhibition strategy (“I shut my mouth”) which increases internal pressure and the risk of explosion.
- Conflicted relationship with food, particularly difficulties chewing or swallowing certain textures (e.g., tough meat) → mild food-related OCD, without a full-blown eating disorder but with a disrupted body connection.
- Sensory hypersensitivity (taste, texture, bodily sensations).
- Anticipatory anxiety about pregnancy: fear of taking a test, bodily pregnancy-like sensations (pseudocyesis).
- Phobic avoidance of highways, especially when someone else is driving → anxious need for control linked to a past traumatic event (accident).
- Ambivalent attitude toward control: desire to manage everything (belongings, meals, road safety), but mental exhaustion from hypervigilance.
- Possible traits of anxious-obsessive personality or mild OCD, particularly around safety, orderliness, and food.
- Need for emotional relief and a space to exist without managing everything.

# Dominant Emotions
- Stress, fatigue, repressed then explosive anger, sense of injustice, fear (control/loss of control), food disgust, diffuse anxiety, emotional hypersensitivity.

# Triggers and Mechanisms
- Silent accumulation of micro-annoyances, regular emotional inhibition, lack of assertive expression, leading to brutal outbursts.
- Anxious overcontrol of the body and environment → defensive strategy against a world perceived as unpredictable.
- Active avoidance of anxiety-inducing situations (highway, pregnancy test, verbal confrontation) → maintains the anxiety loop.
- Sensory discomfort experienced as aggression (e.g., tough meat), reflecting a dissociated relationship with the body.

# Limiting Beliefs
- “If I don’t manage things, no one will.”
- “I must stay silent to avoid conflict.”
- “I’m not allowed to explode, but sometimes I can’t take it anymore.”
- “I don’t trust my body (for digestion, driving, or handling pregnancy).”
- “I carry the mental load alone.”

# Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions
   - Anti-stress breathing exercise (3-4-5 or cardiac coherence) twice daily to reduce reactivity threshold.
   - Emotional self-observation journal: “When do I start boiling?”, “What drains me the most each day?”
   - Quick post-anger grounding protocol: walk alone for 10 min / apply a cold wet cloth / visually step away from mess.
   - Body scan focused on throat and jaw (key blockage areas related to food).
   
2. Intermediate Solutions
   - Gentle assertiveness training: learning to say “I need help” without fear of conflict → role-play / symbolic dramatization.
   - Sensory reconditioning with food: introduce meats in softer forms (minced, blended) to bypass texture aversion without confrontation.
   - Gradual, safe exposure to highway: daytime driving, 15 minutes, on familiar and predictable route, accompanied by a trusted person.
   
3. Long-Term Solutions
   - Emotion/scheme-oriented therapy to dismantle core overcontrol and self-inhibition patterns.
   - Regular hypnosis sessions to:
     - Reprogram emotional tolerance.
     - Reconnect with bodily sensations (food, driving, fatigue).
     - Let go of control-based automatisms.

# Progress Indicators
- Weekly emotional load scale (0 to 10).
- Self-observation journal of emotional outbursts (frequency, duration, intensity).
- Behavioral flexibility indicator: “Did I allow myself not to control everything today?”
- Post-session feedback: muscular tension before/after, appetite, sleep quality.
