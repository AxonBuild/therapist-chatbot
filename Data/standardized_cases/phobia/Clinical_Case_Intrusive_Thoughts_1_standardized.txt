Male, 19 years old  

Summary of Issues  
• Impulse phobia: violent, unwanted, anxiety-inducing mental images, with a dissociation between will and perception of the danger of acting out.  
• Social avoidance and digital withdrawal: slight reduction in time spent on TikTok, but immediate shift to video games, without real diversification of activities.  
• Hypersensitivity to others’ gaze and mild social anxiety: difficulty speaking to strangers, discomfort in public places like the gym.  
• Hypermentalization: low emotional verbalization, difficulty feeling or naming emotions linked to intrusive thoughts.  
• Implicit self-devaluation: feeling of being “abnormal,” difficulty envisioning a positive self-evolution.  
• Positive behavioral mobilization started (driving school, gym), but still fragile and highly context-dependent.  

Dominant Emotions  
• Ambivalence  
• Fear (of self, of losing control)  
• Anger (unexpressed, possibly internalized)  
• Latent sadness (unspoken)  
• Shame or implicit discomfort  

Triggers and Mechanisms  
Triggers:  
• Exposure to violent content (TV, social media)  
• Noisy or oppressive sensory environments (crowded rooms)  
• Prolonged solitude / mental confinement through screen use  
• Psychological fatigue due to rumination  

Chain Mechanisms:  
Hypervigilance → Mental intrusion (violent images) → Anxious doubt → Need for checking or avoidance → Increased digital withdrawal → Reinforcement of phobic cycle  

Limiting Beliefs  
• “I might be dangerous without wanting to be.”  
• “I’m different, maybe abnormal.”  
• “If I expose myself, I lose control.”  
• “If I feel too much, it overflows.”  

Proposed Solutions  
1. Immediate Solutions:  
• “Stop Image” technique: associate a neutral mental image (e.g., a door closing) to interrupt the intrusive thought as soon as it appears.  
• Cardiac coherence 3x/day: to calm the autonomic nervous system and prevent stress peaks that favor intrusive thoughts.  
• Automatic writing: 5 minutes/day to jot down violent thoughts without judgment, like a controlled mental discharge.  

2. Intermediate Solutions:  
• Gradual social exposure work: 1 interaction/week with a non-familiar person (e.g., asking a question in a store).  
• Cognitive reprogramming: actively reframe the belief “I’m dangerous” into “I’m vigilant precisely because I don’t want to harm.”  
• Morning physical activation ritual: 10 minutes of walking or core exercises every morning to stimulate bodily anchoring.  

3. Long-Term Solutions:  
• Hypnosis focused on deactivating the “internal danger” schema  
• Guided meditation to dissociate image/identity: “What I see does not define me”  
• Progressive program for reinvestment in non-digital social activities  

Progress Indicators  
• Frequency of intrusive thoughts (daily > weekly > occasional)  
• Perceived stress level after thoughts (self-rated from 1 to 10)  
• Number of weekly social interactions  
• Daily accumulated screen-free time  
• Weekly self-assessment: “Do I feel more in control of my mind this week?”
