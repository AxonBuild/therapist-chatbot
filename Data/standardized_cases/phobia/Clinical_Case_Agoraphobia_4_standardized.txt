# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
Female – 48 years

## Summary of Issues
Primary Issue (priority): Situational phobia with agoraphobic features, centered on:
- Enclosed, unavoidable spaces (MRI, highways, medical exams).
- Panic fear of being unable to escape.
- Extreme physiological reactions without identifiable conscious fear.

Associated Secondary Issues:
- Maternal over-control: difficulty leaving her daughters alone despite their autonomy → anticipatory guilt, fear of failing them in case of danger.
- Early loss of carefree state: father’s death, early responsibilities in an unsupportive environment.
- Ambivalence with letting go: tension between desire to enjoy time with husband and persistent anxiety.

## Dominant Emotions
- Panic anxiety
- Guilt
- Ambivalence (desired joy / fear of enjoying it)
- Inner tension
- Sadness about the inability to feel light-hearted
- Frustration

## Triggers and Mechanisms
Triggers and Reactions:
- MRI, highways, medical exams → Feeling trapped → Panic activation without real danger.
- Absence of daughters at home → Catastrophic thoughts, fear they might need her → anticipatory guilt.
- Disconnecting from daily routine (weekend) → Paradoxical discomfort → tension between legitimate pleasure and anticipated threat.

Central Mechanism: symbolic agoraphobia = inability to escape a situation + anticipation of losing control = physiological alarm activation.

Immersive Situation & Emotional Anchoring:
Imagine yourself on a highway. No traffic, clear skies. Yet, as you drive, your mind scans for exits. “What if I want to get off now?”… but there’s no exit nearby. Like an endless corridor. Heart racing, palms sweating. You know everything is under control, but your body acts as if an invisible danger is imminent.

Or in that MRI room. Lying down, the metallic noise surrounds you, the headset is on. You know it’s just a machine, that you’re safe… and yet, the inability to move triggers that archaic alarm: “What if I get stuck? What if I can’t get out?”...

It’s not the fear of dying. It’s the fear of not being able to escape.

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I must handle everything to protect others.”
- “If I don’t control, danger may arise.”
- “I can’t afford to be carefree.”

## Proposed Solutions
Immediate Solutions (quick autonomy):
- Soothing anticipation exercise: visualize the exit before entering (e.g.: “I know where and when I can get out, I take back control.”)
- Pre-crisis '3-3-3 sensory' technique: 3 sounds, 3 sensations, 3 objects to name → anchoring in the present moment.
- Box breathing before trips or exams (4s inhale – 4s hold – 4s exhale – 4s hold) to calm the amygdala.

Intermediate Solutions (moderate recurrence):
- Heart coherence targeting loss of control (morning and before anxiety-inducing events).
- Brief therapy on catastrophic scenarios: imaginary graduated exposure (e.g.: visualize the MRI and exiting it).
- Pre-departure security ritual: leave a note to her daughters, establish a comforting routine.

Long-term Solutions:
- Hypnotic reprogramming of the security pattern (see script below).
- Work on the relationship with motherhood and symbolic letting go (Parenting Phase 3).
- Mourning the loss of carefree moments + cultivating active lightness: create micro-moments of conscious rest without guilt.

## Progress Indicators
Indicator – Recommended Follow-up:
- Physiological tension before an event → Scale 0–10 before/after session.
- Frequency of avoidance (MRI, highway) → Weekly self-journal.
- Catastrophic thoughts about children → Record occurrences and intensity (0–10).
- Feeling of inner freedom → Weekly question: “Did I feel free today?”

Final Motivational Phrase:
“You won’t always be able to control the roads… but you can always learn to create a refuge within yourself, an inner space that nothing can lock down. Even when everything feels closed, you can breathe.”
