# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
- Age: 49 years old
- Gender: Female

## Summary of Issues
- The patient is experiencing a loss of professional meaning and emotional disengagement in her work as a lawyer. She feels she is wasting her intellectual potential on trivial cases and is disillusioned by the administrative shift in her profession. This has led to anxiety attacks related to work, particularly physical symptoms of anxiety when going to the office. The anxiety stems from a conflict between her originally invested professional identity and the current sense of absurdity. The patient exhibits emotional saturation, defensive hypersensitivity, affective ambivalence, and self-devaluation. This case appears to be related to phobia, particularly in the context of anxiety associated with her professional environment.

## Dominant Emotions
- Frustration (towards clients, institutions, the judicial system)
- Anxiety (linked to loss of meaning and a repetitive empty routine)
- Defensive cynicism (protective mechanism against emotional burnout)
- Ambivalence (between attachment to the initial profession and growing disenchantment)
- Residual sadness / masked depression (emotional disinvestment, moral fatigue)

## Triggers and Mechanisms
- Identified triggers include emotionally demanding or financially disrespectful clients, cases perceived as absurd or intellectually unstimulating, work mornings that trigger morning anxiety, and memories of early career years that were emotionally and financially unrewarding. The anxiety mechanism is characterized by a daily repetition of anticipation leading to physical anxiety, mental avoidance, cynicism, emotional drain, and existential rumination.

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I must love my clients to do a good job.”
- “I must endure everything because I chose this profession.”
- “I have no credible alternative to my current career.”
- “If I no longer feel empathy, something is wrong with me.”
- “Others always want to take advantage of me or my energy.”

## Proposed Solutions
### Immediate Solutions
- Deep breathing + body anchoring routine in the morning (5-minute routine).
- Quick exercise “give meaning to my day”: each morning, write down one useful thing in her work (even minor).
- Daily mirror phrase: “I am more than what I do. What I do can still evolve.”

### Intermediate Solutions
- Cognitive reframing on the legitimacy of changing or adjusting her activity.
- Creating a “professional attraction assessment”: what originally attracted her to law, what still remains?
- Exploring specialization or transmission paths (training, writing, legal animation, etc.) to revalue her expertise differently.
- Desensitization plan to administrative absurdity through guided humorous recontextualization.

### Long-Term Solutions
- Therapeutic support with targeted hypnosis for existential exhaustion and inner reconversion.
- Deep work on the schema “I must endure to exist.”
- Reclaiming professional identity aligned with core values: freedom, intellectual stimulation, social impact.
- Gradual implementation of a new professional or intra-professional project: soft reorientation possible.

## Progress Indicators
- Frequency and intensity of morning anxiety.
- Ability to differentiate absurd from structurally meaningful cases.
- Frequency of avoidance thoughts (“I don’t want to go”) replaced by desire or curiosity.
- Emergence of new professional or creative desires.
