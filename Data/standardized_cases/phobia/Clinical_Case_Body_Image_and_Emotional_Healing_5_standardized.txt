# Summary of Issues
1. Body Image Disorder
   - Persistent feeling of being 'too fat' despite a body deemed normal by others.
   - Control strategies: deprivation, exercise, food avoidance.
   - Established dysmorphia rooted in self-judgment and hyper-control.

2. Internalized School Bullying
   - Active and passive bullying from middle school to 9th grade (threats, isolation, emotional manipulation).
   - Residual fear, withdrawal, and social mistrust.
   - Association between external judgment and relational danger.

3. Restrictive Family Legacy
   - Parental model focused on weight control (obese brother, early imposed restrictions).
   - Repeated messages: 'it's not his fault', reinforcing guilt and comparison.
   - Moralized relationship with food.

4. Professional Fatigue and Psychological Saturation
   - Gradual emotional disengagement in nursing ('I do what I have to do').
   - Exhaustion despite professionalism and patient recognition.
   - Attempted career change hindered by ineffective administrative support.

# Dominant Emotions
- Frustration, guilt, shame, residual fear, internalized anger, disillusionment.

# Triggers and Mechanisms
- Situations involving food-related pleasure (immediate blockage).
- Comments about appearance.
- Feeling excluded or unheard.
- Administrative or hierarchical dysfunctions (increase sense of powerlessness).

# Limiting Beliefs
- 'If I enjoy myself, I gain weight.'
- 'My body is a problem to solve.'
- 'I must not be weak, I must keep functioning.'
- 'I’m too different to be accepted.'
- 'If I don’t control everything, I fall apart.'

# Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions
   - Food deconditioning exercise: observe a food purchase situation, note automatic thoughts → reframe.
   - Guided self-compassion (3 min/day): speak to oneself as to a friend ('You’re doing your best, and that’s already a lot.').
   - Positive body anchoring exercise: 1 minute of body gratitude each morning ('Thank you, legs', etc.).

2. Intermediate Solutions
   - EMDR sessions focused on:
     - Daily threats during school.
     - Repeated restrictive phrases heard at home.
     - Gazes on the body in changing rooms, stores, etc.
   - Therapeutic writing: letters to key figures of the past (unsent), especially 'Cynthia' from school.

3. Long-Term Solutions
   - Reconnecting with body-pleasure (hypnosis + sensory work).
   - Gentle career redirection: coaching around meaning/values before any career change.
   - Restore inner safety by integrating old wounds, without rejection or overadaptation.

# Progress Indicators
- Subjective body scale: weekly rating of 'how I feel in my body.'
- Emotional journal: one sentence per day with 'Today, I was kind to myself when...'
- Professional energy indicator: '0 to 10, how much did I want to go to work today?'

# Final Motivation Statement
“You no longer have to earn your body. It’s already yours. You no longer have to earn your space. It belongs to you.”
