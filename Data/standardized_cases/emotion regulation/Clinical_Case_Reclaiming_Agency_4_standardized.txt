# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
- Age: 15 (referring to Audrey in the immersive situation)
- Gender: Female
- No other demographic details provided

## Summary of Issues
- The patient experiences existential frustration, implicit guilt linked to professional choices and family history, fear of judgment and exposure, nostalgia tinged with regret about youthful choices, and affective ambivalence towards partner, parents, and life decisions. 
- Identified cognitive patterns include beliefs that she must please others to be loved, that she does not deserve success unless she suffers for it, that expressing her true nature is dangerous, and that pursuing her passions would betray others. 
- This case appears to be related to emotion regulation.

## Dominant Emotions
- Existential frustration
- Implicit guilt
- Fear of judgment and exposure
- Nostalgia tinged with regret
- Affective ambivalence

## Triggers and Mechanisms
- Central trigger: the gaze of others, particularly male or authoritative figures, induces infantilization and emotional withdrawal.
- Chain reaction: Hypervigilance → Inner discomfort → Justification → Social unease → Compensation attempt → Increased discomfort.
- Underlying mechanism: confusion between authentic inner voice and internalized parental voices.
- Blocked trajectory: clear desire to pursue photography, communication, and event planning, but no inner permission to do so.

## Limiting Beliefs
- I must please/meet expectations to be loved.
- I don’t deserve success unless I suffer for it.
- Expressing my true nature is dangerous / judged / rejected.
- If I do what I love, I betray others or take up too much space.

## Proposed Solutions
A. Immediate solutions – Reconnection and expression:
- Direct verbalization of discomfort: Saying aloud an emotion + context.
- Daily “I feel / I say” practice: training to verbalize simply.
- Morning reconnection ritual: hand on heart, slow breathing, anchoring phrase: “Today, I can listen to my true desires.”

B. Intermediate solutions – Inner restructuring:
- Guided review of past choices: write a letter to her 15-year-old self.
- Inner dialogue between “frustrated child” and “wise adult”: self-coaching exercise.
- Therapy based on values: clarifying what resonates with her today.

C. Long-term solutions – Reconciliation with her history:
- Hypnosis sessions to reprogram the relationship with others’ gaze.
- Progressive work on unconditional self-esteem.
- Symbolic project: restart a creative project previously set aside.
- Emotional release sessions focused on high school years and the period of “deviation.”

## Progress Indicators
- Weekly emotional indicator: level of alignment (0 to 10).
- Self-assessment of decisions aligned with her true self.
- Evolution in relationship to external judgment: increased ease saying “no,” social lightness.
- Markers of inner reconquest: moments of enthusiasm, creativity, serene affirmation.
