# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
- Age: 38 years old
- Gender: Female
- Occupation: Educational Assistant

## Summary of Issues
- Main Issue: Post-traumatic anxiety related to pathological pregnancies (ectopic, molar pregnancy, blighted ovum) with somatic triggers and loss of bodily trust.
- Somatic anxiety: panic peaks triggered by physical symptoms (tingling), with immediate catastrophic thoughts (“I’m going to die”).
- Active traumatic memory: ectopic pregnancy with severe internal bleeding, post-operative awakening marked by a brutal announcement (“one more day and you would have died”).
- Diffuse guilt: surrounding uncarried pregnancies, reinforced by misunderstanding the body (“why is this happening to me?”, “my body isn’t working”).
- Hyper-rationalization & comparison: tendency to minimize her own suffering by comparing it to others’, generating a form of emotional self-invalidation.
- Emotional overadaptation: desire not to “add grief to grief,” at the expense of her own feelings.
- Disconnection from the body: loss of trust in pain as an alert signal, development of a limiting belief about her resilience (“I’m too resilient to feel the signals”).

## Dominant Emotions
- Chest tightness, physiological anxiety (tachycardia, remembered physical pain)
- Fear of dying, acute panic
- Underlying anger (toward the body, the injustice of events)
- Suppressed sadness, internalized guilt
- Sense of existential injustice

## Triggers and Mechanisms
- Triggers: any atypical physical sensation (tingling, pain, discomfort) revives the bodily trauma.
- Mechanism: perception of a failing body → anxiety → loss of control → panic peak → attempt to regain control through breathing techniques (e.g., Respirelax).
- Underlying schema: “I can’t trust my body / I must control everything or I’ll fall apart.”

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I’m too resilient to feel the signals.”
- “Resisting pain ≠ ignoring signals.”
- “It’s not my body’s fault.”

## Proposed Solutions
Immediate Solutions:
- Guided coherent breathing (Respirelax – 5/5, 3 minutes), paired with an anchor (e.g., safety gesture or mental image).
- Internal emotional validation dialogue: “What I went through was a real ordeal. My feelings are valid.”
- Personalized crisis sheet: track symptoms / thoughts / actions taken / post-action feelings.

Intermediate Solutions:
- Cognitive restructuring of beliefs: “Resisting pain ≠ ignoring signals” / “It’s not my body’s fault.”
- Emotional journaling: guided writing on each pregnancy → what I lost, what I overcame, what I forgive myself for.
- Regular EMDR sessions to desensitize highly charged memories (post-op awakening, wait before surgery, harsh medical announcements).

Long-Term Solutions:
- Immersive hypnosis session: Reconnection to the body – Reconciliation with pain – Deactivation of traumatic memory.
- Sensory body meditation to recreate inner safety through bodily sensations.
- Progressive resilience anchoring: regular visualization of the resources mobilized at each stage (e.g., the colleague who encouraged her to consult, post-crisis management, courage through pain…).

## Final Motivational Phrase
“You stood when your body could have fallen. Today, it’s time not only to survive in your body, but to return to it as a friend. Your story doesn’t define you – your ability to transform it will.”
