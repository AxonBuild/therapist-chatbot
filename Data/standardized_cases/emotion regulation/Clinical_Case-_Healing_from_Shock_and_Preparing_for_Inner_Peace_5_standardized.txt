# Demographics
- Age: 30 years old
- Gender: Female

# Summary of Issues
- Latent emotional hypervigilance in a context of psychological fatigue.
- Sleep disturbances linked to underlying tension not identified as anxiety.
- Partial emotional dissociation (stress not identified as such, denial or mentalization).
- Anticipated risk of postpartum breakdown in case of pregnancy.
- Acute emotional shock reaction to a phone call involving trauma (bereavement or serious event).
- Initial resistance to emotional openness, tension between the desire to open up and fear of inner exposure.
- Inner feeling of loneliness in emotional management.
- This case appears to be related to emotion regulation.

# Dominant Emotions
- Stunned reaction
- Sadness
- Confusion
- Anticipatory fear
- Stress related to parenthood
- Emotional restraint in expressing pain

# Triggers and Mechanisms
- Trigger: A phone call with upsetting news → provokes emotional shock.
- Chain reaction: Shock → confusion → sadness → loss of bearings → need for control → emotional inhibition → insomnia → hypervigilance.
- Current coping strategy: Emotional containment, use of melatonin, vague verbalization (“I’m stressed but not anxious”), partial avoidance of the traumatic memory.

# Limiting Beliefs
- “I have to hold on alone”
- “I must not say too much or I’ll break down”
- “If I start to let go, I won’t be able to get back up”
- “I need to prepare a perfect emotional ground before becoming a mother”
- “What I feel is not anxiety, so it’s not serious”

# Proposed Solutions
A. Immediate Solutions (starting today):
- Box breathing + cardiac coherence 3x/day (5 min)
- Bodily self-anchoring before sleep: “I am here. I am safe. My body can settle.”
- Nighttime journal of unfiltered emotions: 5 minutes of free writing before bed
- Melatonin + gentle sensory anchoring (music, scent, or weight) to re-associate sleep with safety

B. Intermediate Solutions:
- EMDR or hypnosis focused on emotional shock (the memory of the phone call)
- Gradual work on deactivating internal alert (gentle bilateral stimulation + visualization of reconstruction)
- Emotional preparation for parenthood: working on control, expectations, and emotional transmission schemas

C. Long-term Solutions:
- Program “Preparing my inner self to welcome life”: 6 to 8 sessions supporting hidden vulnerabilities.
- Specific post-trauma hypnosis sessions: deactivation of the initial shock, peaceful rereading of sensory memory, liberation from the image of the father as the bearer of the trauma.
- Reconstruction of vital momentum and internal emotional safety before any motherhood project.

# Progress Indicators
- Daily subjective scale: Sleep quality / tension level / inner safety
- Weekly validation: Ability to connect with emotions without being overwhelmed
- Stabilization indicators: Restorative sleep for 3 consecutive nights, ability to mention the memory without being stunned, return of a positive desire or project.
