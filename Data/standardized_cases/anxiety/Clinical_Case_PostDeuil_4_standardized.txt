Triggers and Mechanisms  
- Central trigger: Deterioration of the mother’s health in an environment perceived as hostile and incompetent.  
- Recurrent mechanism: Emotional fusion with the mother → perceived vital duty of protection → failure of this mission → self-destructive guilt.  
- Reactivation of old patterns: Systemic abuse reactivates control and domination experiences from a past violent relationship.  

Limiting Beliefs  
- 'If I don't do everything, others fail or disappear.'  
- 'Others are negligent; I'm the only one who can truly care.'  
- 'Love is proven through total sacrifice.'  
- 'Structures meant to protect become places of danger.'  

Proposed Solutions  
1. Immediate Solutions  
   - Post-trauma self-soothing exercise: guided breathing with visualization of the mother peaceful in a safe place.  
   - Directed cathartic writing: a letter to her mother expressing everything that couldn’t be said or acknowledged.  
   - 'I am not guilty of…' exercise → Recognizing objective facts and placing them within a systemic, non-personal context.  
2. Intermediate Solutions  
   - Progressive work on dismantling sacrificial beliefs.  
   - 'Acts of presence' journal to document everything she did.  
   - Recontextualizing guilt-related emotions (e.g., inner child work).  
   - Body scan practice to detect emotional overload signals.  
3. Long-term Solutions  
   - Symbolic hypnotherapy: reintegrate the mother figure into a peaceful memory.  
   - Healing of the wounded feminine: restore self-esteem degraded by the abusive relationship and fusion with a dominant or idealized mother.  
   - Rituals of passage: personal ceremony to close this chapter (burning a letter, planting a tree, etc.).  

Progress Indicators  
- Recommended Hypnosis/Meditation Sessions  
   1. Hypnosis to release the invisible burden: Allow the body to release the symbolic weight (mother, anger, responsibility).  
   2. Immersive reparative grief session: Recreate a peaceful final exchange with the mother.  
   3. Guided meditation 'You did what you could': Gentle, deep repetition of a non-blaming message.  
   4. Inner reconciliation hypnosis: Work on the split between the woman who wants to move forward and the one stuck in pain.
