# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
- Age: 24 years old
- Gender: Transgender man

## Summary of Issues
The patient is experiencing severe anxiety symptoms, including a recent acute panic attack characterized by a fear of re-experiencing it, bodily hypervigilance, and a constant fear of dying or losing control. Additional issues include attention difficulties suggestive of possible ADHD, a dysfunctional family background, an insecure living environment, and a relationship under acute stress with a depressive and suicidal partner. The patient also reports feelings of depersonalization/derealization and is undergoing an existential crisis with a loss of direction.

## Dominant Emotions
- Fear (of dying, losing control, not making it through)
- Sadness (loss of vital energy, isolation, helplessness)
- Shame (sense of failure, negative social comparison)
- Guilt (not being able to help the partner, not being “productive”)
- Repressed anger (toward parents, self, or life?)

## Triggers and Mechanisms
Immediate trigger: Panic episode linked to physical and emotional exhaustion (smoking, stress, emotional overload).
Recent aggravating event: Partner’s suicidal crisis, leading to feelings of helplessness and direct exposure to trauma.
Chronic factors include uncompensated attention issues, long-standing feelings of worthlessness since childhood, and low social support in an unstable environment. The psychological mechanism involves emotional overload in the amygdala, interpreting sensations as danger signals, and a vicious cycle of hypervigilance, anxiety, physical symptoms, fear of dying, panic, and trauma reinforcement.

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I can’t move forward.”
- “I don’t deserve better.”
- “I’m a burden to others.”
- “I’m different, unfit, out of sync.”
- “If I feel this, it means I’m going to die or go crazy.”

## Proposed Solutions
Immediate solutions include grounding body scan exercises, cardiac coherence practices three times a day, stopping compulsive online searches, and maintaining a daily journal. Intermediate solutions involve a neuropsychological assessment for possible ADHD, targeted EMDR therapy, psychoeducational support, and life-path coaching. Long-term solutions consist of regular hypnosis to deactivate automatic fear responses, therapeutic work on parental figures, and establishing a structured daily rhythm.

## Progress Indicators
Progress will be monitored using a subjective scale from 0 to 10 on daily anxiety, frequency of alarming bodily sensations, ability to be present, feeling of being an “actor” in one’s life, self-esteem, and through an emotional journal (2 min/day). Goals include stabilizing sleep and reducing fear of panic within one month, restarting a realistic personal project within two months, and regaining pleasure in an emotional bond within three months.
