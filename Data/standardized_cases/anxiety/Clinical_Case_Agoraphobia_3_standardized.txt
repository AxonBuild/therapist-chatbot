# Demographics

# Summary of Issues
1. Agoraphobia with Obsessive-Compulsive Component (OCD)
   - Fear of being trapped or unable to escape (highways, beauty treatments, restaurants).
   - Sensation of losing control, intrusive thoughts ("impulse phobia").
   - Acute awareness of the irrational nature of fears, but inability to detach from them.
2. Panic Disorder and Spasmophilia
   - First episode at age 25 on the highway, unresolved, became an emotional anchor.
   - Unpredictable panic attacks with somatic symptoms.
3. Complex Post-Traumatic Stress (Cumulative Traumas)
   - Sudden death of the father.
   - Severe stroke of the brother → strong sense of family responsibility.
   - Mother’s cancer and resulting cognitive impairments → overwhelming mental burden.
   - Traumatic childbirth and difficult pregnancy (during Covid context).
4. Hyper-responsibility and “Family Pillar” Role
   - Emotional and logistical management of the entire family.
   - Progressive emotional collapse, frequent crying, emotional lability.
5. Disappointing Therapeutic Experiences
   - Psychologists perceived as lacking empathy or overly reductive.
   - Psychiatrists focused solely on medication.
   - Ineffective hypnosis, leading to a feeling of "personal failure".

# Dominant Emotions
- Fear (of the unpredictable, of losing control, of collapsing).
- Guilt (for not being able to "let go").
- Intense emotional and mental fatigue.
- Anger mixed with resignation.
- Silent shame (for not “doing well” despite constant effort).

# Triggers and Mechanisms
- Constant hypervigilance in any uncontrollable situation.
- Intrusive thoughts + somatic anxiety → panic loop.
- Nervous system in chronic alert mode due to successive traumas.
- Emotional anchoring to the highway as a symbol of danger.
- Active avoidance of anxiety-provoking contexts, reinforcing the fear.

# Limiting Beliefs
- "I have to hold it together for everyone."
- "If I let go, everything will fall apart."
- "I’m too tense for this to work on me."
- "The problem is me."

# Proposed Solutions
Immediate Solutions
- Conscious breathing in controlled settings (body scan with sensory anchoring).
- Emotional journal (self-assessment morning/evening with anxiety intensity scale).
- Gentle reintroduction of anxiety-inducing contexts with gradually reduced avoidance strategies.

Intermediate Solutions
- Targeted EMDR therapy focused on the highway memory (initial anchor point).
- Mental reprogramming around control beliefs (metaphorical and body-based work).
- Immersive visualization exercises with built-in escape options (defusing rigid mental scenarios).

Long-Term Solutions
- Structured EMDR protocol in three phases:
  1. Processing the initial trauma (panic attack).
  2. Processing grief and accumulated emotional overload.
  3. Reinforcing the sense of inner safety.
- Immersive meditation on safety and positive experiences of non-control.

# Final Motivational Phrase
You were never incapable of letting go. You simply learned too well how to hold it all together. Now, little by little, you’re going to learn how to set down the weight you never chose to carry alone.
