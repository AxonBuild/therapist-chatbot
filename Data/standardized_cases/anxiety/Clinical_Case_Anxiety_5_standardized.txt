# Demographics
- Female, 12 years old

# Summary of Issues
- Somatic anxiety (dizziness, blurred vision, sensation of weakness after physical exertion)
- Panic attack triggered by physical effort and relative fasting (likely hypoglycemia)
- Fear of dying by voluntarily stopping breathing, indicating a respiratory impulse phobia (fear of unintentionally harming herself)
- Recurring negative thoughts about herself (guilt or fear of losing control)
- Mental and physical hypersensitivity (focus on physical sensations of anxiety)
- No immediate traumatic events declared, but possible reactivation of older memories (not clearly verbalized yet)
- Lack of understanding of bodily functions, source of anxiety (fear of body “failing,” confusion between thoughts and reality)

# Dominant Emotions
- Fear (of not breathing, of harming herself)
- Diffuse anxiety (linked to stress, hypoglycemia, loss of reference points)
- Confusion/Uncertainty (between physical sensation and real danger)
- Unconscious guilt (she says, “I’m afraid I’m the one who might do it”)
- Emotional vulnerability during a transition phase (pre-adolescence)

# Triggers and Mechanisms
- Immediate trigger: physical effort (biking) + insufficient food intake → energy drop → anxious sensations → fear spiral
- Amplification mechanism: catastrophic interpretation of bodily signals (thoughts like “what if I stop breathing”)
- Rumination focused on breathing (mild impulse phobia, needs monitoring)
- Mention of a missed call to her mother in a previous session: possible fear of abandonment or emotional insecurity anchor

# Limiting Beliefs
- “I might lose control of myself.”
- “I could stop breathing without meaning to.”
- “My thoughts can harm me.”
- “If I feel something strongly, it must be dangerous.”

These patterns reflect a form of bodily control anxiety, typical of emerging anxiety disorders during adolescence.

# Proposed Solutions
## Immediate Solutions
1. Body Psychoeducation:
   - Explain that the body is programmed to survive (e.g., respiratory reflex, impossibility of “stopping breathing” voluntarily)
   - Use simple analogies (e.g., the elephant and the mouse for irrational fears)
2. Calming Breath:
   - Friendly breath exercise: place one hand on the chest, one on the belly, and breathe deeply while imagining the air as a comforting friend
3. Emergency Movement in Case of Anxiety:
   - Gently bounce on the feet (body grounding)
   - Press hands against a wall (to feel strength and return to the present)

## Intermediate Solutions
1. Simple Emotional Journal:
   - Each day, write: what I felt, what I thought, what I did to feel better
2. Safe Visualization:
   - Create an imaginary safe place she can retreat to when anxiety rises
3. Work on Automatic Thoughts:
   - E.g., replace “What if I stop breathing?” with “My body knows how to breathe, I can trust it.”

## Long-Term Solutions: Hypnosis and Meditation
Recommended Hypnosis Themes:
- “Your breath is your ally”: reconciliation with breathing and bodily trust
- “Inner calm despite the storm”: learning to let thoughts pass without fear
- “The body that watches over you”: visualizing the body as a wise and protective ally

Suggested Hypnosis Script (to be created if needed)

Title: “Your Body Knows What It’s Doing”
Objectives:
- Deactivate the fear of respiratory loss of control
- Install an anchor of inner safety
- Strengthen bodily and emotional trust

# Progress Indicators
- Emotional indicator: 1 to 10 scale of breathing anxiety before/after session
- Frequency of intrusive thoughts (weekly self-evaluation)
- Number of situations where she was able to reassure herself (journal)
- Inner safety indicator: “How safe do I feel in my body today?”
