# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
Age: 80 years old  
Gender: Female  
Marital Status: Widow  
Occupation: Retired antique dealer  

## Summary of Issues
The patient presents with acute anxiety linked to the fear of dying alone. This anxiety is exacerbated by sudden weight loss, which triggers memories of her husband's illness and death from cancer. Associated behaviors include getting dressed quickly to avoid being found naked, indicating a ritualization tied to her death phobia. She experiences a recurring fear of being found dead, alone, and without dignity. Additionally, the patient exhibits hyper-mentalization and difficulty accessing bodily sensations, remaining highly verbal but disconnected from her emotional experiences. There is an unresolved emotional imprint of grief following the loss of her husband during Covid, compounded by a lack of traditional mourning support. The patient also experiences projective identification with her children, feeling powerless in the face of their suffering, which reactivates her own emotional lack of support.

## Dominant Emotions
- Existential anxiety  
- Emotional loneliness  
- Masked diffuse sadness  
- Latent guilt (towards her children, her health, her past choices)  

## Triggers and Mechanisms
1. Scale/weight → memory of husband’s illness.  
2. Isolation → waking without support → morning anxiety peak.  
3. Children’s suffering → painful echo of her own wounds.  
4. Inability to travel → experience of lost vitality, frustration.  

## Limiting Beliefs
- 'If I lose weight, it's the beginning of the end.'  
- 'I must be ready to die, but properly.'  
- 'I am alone with my anxieties.'  
- 'Analysis is not enough, but I don’t know how to feel.'  

## Proposed Solutions
**Immediate Solutions**  
- Emergency grounding: sternum self-massage + “4-4-8” breathing as soon as anxiety arises.  
- Verbal self-grounding: repeat aloud “I am here, I am alive, it’s not now.”  
- Symbolic preparation for end-of-life staging: conscious ritualization to deactivate the fear of dying alone.  

**Intermediate Solutions**  
- Continue EMDR sessions (3 to 6) to address:  
  - The trauma of the SMS announcement  
  - The inability to accompany her husband early on  
  - Current solitude in facing anxiety  
  - The triggering episode of weight loss  
- Daily feeling journal (even if vague at first) to reconcile thought and sensation.  

**Long-Term Solutions**  
- Guided hypnosis on reconciliation with solitude: transform solitude seen as void into a space of inner connection (script to be created).  
- Immersive meditation on transmission: highlight her emotional role in the family as a keeper of memories and stories (echoing her passion for antiques).  
- Symbolic grief integration therapy: letter to husband + voice expression + symbolic burial.  

**Tailored Hypnosis/Meditation Session (to be created)**
