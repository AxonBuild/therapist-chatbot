# Demographics
Female, 19 years old

# Summary of Issues
- Unstable and conflictual family relationships: chronic conflict with the mother, repeated disappointments and betrayal by the father, climate of mistrust and double discourse (e.g., what the father says about her to the mother).
- Repeatedly broken hopes for reconciliation, especially with the father: oscillation between relational illusion and brutal return to reality.
- High level of emotional vigilance and mistrust: constant need to protect herself, disillusioned discourse, emotional withdrawal as a defense mechanism (“I don’t care,” “It doesn’t matter”).
- Intense mental load due to physical exhaustion (internship + commuting) and family stress.
- Sleep disorder marked by hyperactivation: difficulty falling asleep despite going to bed early, persistent mental activity, probable bodily tension.
- Need for validation, listening, and recognition, particularly embodied by the grandmother figure (containing function, “like my therapist”).
- Underlying beliefs:
   - “I have to defend myself alone.”
   - “You can’t trust anyone, even those you love.”
   - “If I let my guard down, I’ll get hurt.”
   - “I’m seen as a problem, not as a person.”

# Dominant Emotions
- Disappointment
- Sadness
- Hurt pride
- Confusion
- Suppressed anger
- Sense of injustice
- Latent anxiety
- Psychological exhaustion

# Triggers and Mechanisms
- Indirect and malicious communication from parents (behind her back)
- Lack of recognition for personal investment (internship, fatigue)
- Inconsistency in relationships (mother, father)
- Suspicions of being used by parental figures
- Implicit comparisons (dirty vs. clean, good vs. bad daughter)

# Limiting Beliefs
- “I have to defend myself alone.”
- “You can’t trust anyone, even those you love.”
- “If I let my guard down, I’ll get hurt.”
- “I’m seen as a problem, not as a person.”

# Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions
   - “Reverse body scan” each night before sleep: from top to bottom, then bottom to top to regain bodily control in a safe mode.
   - Emotional separation ritual before bedtime: write down what made her angry in a notebook and close it ritually each evening.
   - “Silent” breathing with mindful awareness: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale for 6, hand placed on chest.
   - Self-anchoring: visualize a place where she feels “non-judged,” associated with a comforting sensory texture (e.g., grandma’s blanket, armchair, a summer bed).
   
2. Intermediate Solutions
   - Family dialogue rewriting session (with AI or therapist) to transform the emotional charge of hurtful words.
   - Emotional remediation exercise focused on the father figure: imagine what she wished he had said instead.
   - Creation of an imaginary “personal space”: symbolic bedroom or mental refuge to activate at bedtime.
   - Audio therapy: use of a gentle, repetitive voice (hypnosis or guided meditation) to deactivate ruminative thinking before sleep.
   
3. Long-Term Solutions
   - Immersive therapeutic hypnosis on the theme: “Let the body digest what the mind holds on to”
     - Goals:
       - Release tension linked to parental expectations.
       - Re-establish an inner protective boundary.
       - Soothe the mind through bodily reconnection.
       - Separate sleep from the toxic family sphere.
   - Personalized Hypnosis Session to Be Programmed
     - Title: “Let the body digest what the mind holds on to”
     - Ambiance: soft silence or soothing sounds (rain, light wind)
     - Dominant sensory approach: kinesthetic (bodily sensations)
     - Guidance level: intermediate (suggestions + visualizations)

# Progress Indicators
- Each night before sleep: rate mental tension level (1 to 5).
- After each audio session: evaluate physical relaxation.
- Weekly sleep curve: number of hours, perceived quality, sleep onset.
- Self-observation of nighttime intrusive thoughts: frequency, intensity.
