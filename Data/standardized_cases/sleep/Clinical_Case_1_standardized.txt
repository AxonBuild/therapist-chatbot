# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
Female, approximately 40 years old (insomnia since age 25, for over 15 years).

## Summary of Issues
1. Severe chronic insomnia (for over 15 years)
   - Difficulty falling asleep or multiple nighttime awakenings.
   - Deeply disrupted sleep pattern.
   - Physical and mental exhaustion.
   - High resistance to medication.

2. Anxious personality with ruminative tendencies
   - Nighttime mental hyperactivity (existential reflections, nocturnal writing).
   - Difficulty letting go and embracing mental stillness.

3. History of major relational trauma (abusive relationship)
   - Experience of psychological, physical, and symbolic violence (confinement, arson, partner’s self-harm, isolation, implicit threats).
   - Survival strategy through simulated submission (“pretending to be with him to get back to safety”).
   - Post-traumatic symptoms: nocturnal visual hallucinations (arachnophobia/hypnagogic hallucinations), possible dissociative episode.

4. Unprocessed emotional burden
   - Lack of external help at the time (isolation abroad).
   - Feeling of having had to save herself alone.
   - Trauma memory still very active.

## Dominant Emotions
- Deep fear (linked to the trauma).
- Extreme fatigue.
- Distress.
- Emotional loneliness.
- Ambivalence between lucidity and helplessness.
- Resilience and desire to heal.

## Triggers and Mechanisms
### Main Emotional Triggers
- Nighttime silence and inactivity = trigger for rumination.
- Prolonged solitude.
- Any situation perceived as loss of control.
- Unconscious resonance of traumatic episodes (e.g., confinement, helplessness).

### Underlying Psychological Mechanisms
- Post-traumatic hypervigilance (body in constant alert mode).
- Anticipatory anxiety (fear of not sleeping, which prevents sleep).
- Sensory emotional memory (linked to nighttime trauma).
- Difficulties in emotional regulation (writing and hypnosis used as partial self-regulation attempts).

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I’m resistant to medication, so nothing can help me.”
- “I have to stay strong, alone, and endure.”
- “My anxiety is part of me, I’ll never be able to change it.”
- “I can’t trust my own body / night is the enemy.”

## Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate solutions:
   - Body grounding exercise to be done at the first signs of mental activation (e.g., lying body scan + 4-7-8 breathing).
   - Targeted “emotional discharge” writing before bed to mentally offload worries.
   - Implementation of a calming and stable evening ritual (soothing atmosphere, dim lighting, constant neutral sounds).
   - Emergency session: hypnosis to deactivate ruminations.

2. Intermediate solutions:
   - Gradual work on the traumatic vigilance pattern (teaching the body to distinguish night from danger).
   - Gentle body movements before bed (e.g., 10 minutes of slow stretching or self-massage).
   - Guided visualization of safe places, anchored to a physical signal (e.g., hand placed on the chest).
   - Start of a reeducation of the relationship to night through gentle desensitization (cognitive restructuring via hypnosis).

3. Long-term solutions:
   - Immersive post-trauma hypnosis sessions (release of body-stored trauma memories).
   - Work on limiting identity beliefs (e.g., “I’m broken” → “I survived, and I deserve rest”).
   - Reconnection to the body through guided kinesthetic meditation.
   - Trauma-focused therapy (EMDR or regressive hypnosis) if accepted later.

## Progress Indicators
- Before each session: rate level of fatigue and mental tension on a scale from 1 to 10.
- After each session: note whether falling asleep was easier, if intrusive thoughts decreased.
- Phase 1 Goal (weeks 1–3): reduce fear of night and of sleeplessness.
- Phase 2: stabilize physical and emotional recovery routines.
- Phase 3: deep restructuring of vigilance patterns.
