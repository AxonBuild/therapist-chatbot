# Demographics
Female, 36 years old

# Summary of Issues
• Chronic sleep-onset insomnia (average latency > 90 minutes)  
• Cognitive hyperarousal at bedtime (ruminations, future scenarios)  
• High mental load related to work and family life  
• Limiting beliefs: “If I don’t sleep, I’ll ruin my day tomorrow”, “I must control my sleep”  
• Emotional resistance to letting go  
• Negative conditioning associated with the bed: bed = insomnia struggle  
• Absence of emotional or physical calming rituals  
• High sensitivity to nocturnal stimuli (sounds, light, internal tension)  

This case appears to be related to sleep disorders, specifically chronic insomnia.

# Dominant Emotions
• Frustration / irritability  
• Anticipatory anxiety  
• Feeling of failure  
• Guilt about not “succeeding in sleeping”  
• Constant physical tension (epigastric area and trapezius)  

# Triggers and Mechanisms
1. End of day = mental activation (task review, fear of forgetting, anticipation of tomorrow)  
2. Getting into bed = activation of control system (“I must fall asleep quickly”)  
3. Intrusive thoughts → muscle tension → adrenaline surge → failure to fall asleep  
4. Vicious circle: the more she fights wakefulness, the more insomnia is reinforced  
5. Unconscious belief: “Falling asleep is a test I must pass”  

# Limiting Beliefs
• “If I don’t sleep, I’ll ruin my day tomorrow”  
• “I must control my sleep”  
• “Falling asleep is a test I must pass”  

# Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions  
   • Cognitive offloading exercise (write intrusive thoughts in a notebook before bed)  
   • Transition ritual: 30 minutes of dim light + calm, non-digital activity  
   • Guided 4-7-8 breathing: to slow the heart rate and activate parasympathetic relaxation  
   • Body scan focused on tension zones (jaw, solar plexus, shoulders)  
   • Ban on “fighting wakefulness”: allow herself to simply be there  

2. Intermediate Solutions  
   • Bed reconditioning: only stay in bed if sleepy. If not, get up for 10 minutes, then return  
   • “Paradoxical intention” technique: consciously say “I will stay awake” to reduce pressure to fall asleep  
   • Visualization of a safe haven (associated with relaxation, used each night)  
   • Use of white noise or binaural sounds to soothe auditory hypervigilance  

3. Long-Term Solutions  
   • Hypnosis sessions focused on letting go, inner safety, and disconnecting the bed from failure  
   • Evening immersive meditations with sensory anchoring (e.g., progressive visualization of a calm, protective place)  
   • Cognitive restructuring of sleep-related beliefs: “Sleep comes when I let go, not when I chase it”  

# Progress Indicators
• Sleep-onset scale: rate ease of falling asleep from 1 to 5 each night  
• Mental watch journal: write 3 recurring thoughts before bed → track changes over time  
• Weekly auto-report: average sleep latency, quality of awakening, emotional state in the morning  
• Motivational tracking: highlighting micro-progress (e.g., “You fell asleep 20 minutes faster than on Monday”)  

# Final Motivational Phrase
“Sleep is not something to chase… it’s inner peace that naturally invites it in. And that peace—you’re already on your way to it.”
