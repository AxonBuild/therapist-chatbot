# Summary of Issues
1. Persistent Sleep Disorder  
   - Difficulty falling asleep despite antidepressant treatment.  
   - Occasional use of Tarax: strong sedative effect but non-restorative.  
2. Multifactorial Chronic Fatigue  
   - High mental load: single parenthood, caring for child alone, dependent mother.  
   - Professional overwork without recovery.  
3. Feeling of Loneliness and Isolation  
   - Rooted since adolescence (absence of mother, sense of abandonment).  
   - Exacerbated by solo parenting and daily overload.  
4. Latent Conflict with Mother  
   - Mother described as childish, incompetent, dependent.  
   - Repressed anger, emotional ambivalence, feeling of injustice.  
5. Underlying Depressive State  
   - Recent SSRI treatment (Prozac type), marked initial side effects.  
   - Little improvement so far, negative impact on sleep.  
6. Financial and Professional Stress  
   - Unexpected increase in expenses (nursery, electricity).  
   - Pressure related to performance in real estate sales.  

# Dominant Emotions
Extreme fatigue, loneliness, repressed anger, stress, resignation, silent self-deprecation.

# Triggers and Mechanisms
Main Trigger:  
Fatigue + mental overload + sense of injustice (lack of help)  

Psychophysiological Chain:  
Hypervigilance (constant control) → Anticipatory anxiety → Insomnia → Exhaustion → Irritability + feeling of loneliness → Contained anger → Reinforced self-pressure  

Traumatic Resonance:  
Adolescent emotional abandonment (motorcycle accident, lack of maternal support) replayed in current motherhood and lack of support. Anger toward current mother reactivates past wounds.

# Limiting Beliefs
“I have to handle everything alone.”  
“I have no one to rely on.”  
“If I let go, everything will collapse.”  
“I’m tired, but I have to hold on.”  
“No help will come.”  

# Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions (Soothing, Recentering):  
   - Guided body scan for exhaustion state + somatic recentering  
   - 4-7-8 breathing (management of falling asleep and nighttime anxiety)  
   - “Imaginary support circle” protocol: visualization of protective figures to soothe loneliness.  
   
2. Intermediate Solutions (Cognitive and Emotional Stabilization):  
   - Implementation of evening rituals (writing, warm light, slow music, etc.)  
   - Mental unloading journal: writing down everything that “weighs” before bedtime to deactivate rumination.  
   - Hypnosis work on the representation of the childish mother: symbolically separating roles, ritualizing emotional detachment.  

3. Long-term Solutions (Schema Rewriting and Healing):  
   - Immersive hypnosis around adolescent loneliness, abandonment wound, and moral fatigue.  
   - Sensory anchoring work of inner support: soothing the feeling of emptiness through secure imagery (inner child, supportive figures).  
   - Cognitive restructuring of beliefs about burden and control.
