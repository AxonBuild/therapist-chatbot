# Clinical Case Document

## Demographics
- Age: 44 years old
- Gender: Female

## Summary of Issues
- Persistent Sleep Disorder: Difficulty falling asleep despite antidepressant treatment; occasional use of Tarax with strong sedative effect but non-restorative.
- Multifactorial Chronic Fatigue: High mental load due to single parenthood, caring for a dependent mother, and professional overwork without recovery.
- Feeling of Loneliness and Isolation: Rooted since adolescence due to absence of mother and sense of abandonment; exacerbated by solo parenting and daily overload.
- Latent Conflict with Mother: Mother described as childish, incompetent, and dependent; repressed anger, emotional ambivalence, and feeling of injustice.
- Underlying Depressive State: Recent SSRI treatment (Prozac type) with marked initial side effects and little improvement so far, negatively impacting sleep.
- Financial and Professional Stress: Unexpected increase in expenses (nursery, electricity) and pressure related to performance in real estate sales.

## Dominant Emotions
- Extreme fatigue
- Loneliness
- Repressed anger
- Stress
- Resignation
- Silent self-deprecation

## Triggers and Mechanisms
- Main Trigger: Fatigue, mental overload, and sense of injustice due to lack of help.
- Psychophysiological Chain: Hypervigilance (constant control) → Anticipatory anxiety → Insomnia → Exhaustion → Irritability + feeling of loneliness → Contained anger → Reinforced self-pressure.
- Traumatic Resonance: Adolescent emotional abandonment (motorcycle accident, lack of maternal support) replayed in current motherhood and lack of support. Anger toward current mother reactivates past wounds.

## Limiting Beliefs
- “I have to handle everything alone.”
- “I have no one to rely on.”
- “If I let go, everything will collapse.”
- “I’m tired, but I have to hold on.”
- “No help will come.”

## Proposed Solutions
1. Immediate Solutions (Soothing, Recentering):
   - Guided body scan for exhaustion state + somatic recentering.
   - 4-7-8 breathing for management of falling asleep and nighttime anxiety.
   - “Imaginary support circle” protocol: visualization of protective figures to soothe loneliness.
2. Intermediate Solutions (Cognitive and Emotional Stabilization):
   - Implementation of evening rituals (writing, warm light, slow music, etc.).
   - Mental unloading journal: writing down everything that “weighs” before bedtime to deactivate rumination.
   - Hypnosis work on the representation of the childish mother: symbolically separating roles, ritualizing emotional detachment.
3. Long-term Solutions (Schema Rewriting and Healing):
   - Immersive hypnosis around adolescent loneliness, abandonment wound, and moral fatigue.
   - Sensory anchoring work of inner support: soothing the feeling of emptiness through secure imagery (inner child, supportive figures).
   - Cognitive restructuring of beliefs about burden and control.
