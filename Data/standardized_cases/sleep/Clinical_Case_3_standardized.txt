Demographics  
Female, 41 years old  

Summary of Issues  
• Sleep disorder with repeated night awakenings (4 to 6 times per night), difficulty falling back asleep  
• Latent nocturnal hypervigilance, often triggered by tiny noises or intrusive thoughts  
• Anxious anticipation of awakening, creating a vicious cycle of sleep-related anxiety  
• High mental load, ruminating about the next day’s tasks during the night  
• Chronic daytime fatigue, irritability, lack of concentration, and guilt  
• Background of a family environment where “rest was not valued,” with an ingrained belief: “I must always be in control or things will fall apart”  
(Note: This case appears to be related to a sleep disorder.)  

Dominant Emotions  
• Anticipatory anxiety  
• Frustration and helplessness  
• Guilt about not being “productive” during the day  
• Feeling of losing control  

Triggers and Mechanisms  
Breakdown of the nocturnal reaction:  
• Phase 1 – Light sleep onset (body relaxed but mind on alert)  
• Phase 2 – Sudden awakening (often after 90–120 minutes)  
• Phase 3 – Automatic mental scanning: “Was there a noise? Did I forget something?”  
• Phase 4 – Cognitive activation: intrusive thoughts, projections about the next day  
• Phase 5 – Struggling against wakefulness: “I *must* fall back asleep or I’ll be useless tomorrow” → Reinforces insomnia  
Link to the past:  
• In childhood, the patient had to stay “on alert” (unstable parent or anxious environment)  
• She associated vigilance with safety—even at night  

Limiting Beliefs  
• If I sleep deeply, I might miss something important.  
• I always need to be ready to respond, even at night.  
• I’m weak if I rest too much.  

Proposed Solutions  
Immediate Solutions  
• “4-7-8” breathing exercise upon awakening to soothe the nervous system  
• Nighttime grounding card: comforting thought or mantra (“I am safe. Everything can wait until tomorrow.”)  
• Get out of bed after 20 minutes of active wakefulness (avoid conditioning the bed as a place of struggle)  
Intermediate Solutions  
• Sleep reconditioning through sensory anchoring (scent, texture, sound)  
• Night awakening journal with kind, pressure-free self-observation  
• Belief retraining via cognitive restructuring: “Deep sleep is my best protection.”  
Long-Term Solutions  
• Regular hypnosis to deactivate internal alert systems  
• Work on inner safety: reinforce the idea that night is a space for release  
• Evening closure rituals (e.g., visualizing a locked chest, symbolic cutoff from the day)  
Recommended Personalized Hypnosis Session  
Title: “Let the Night Watch Over Me”  
Objective: Deactivate the pattern of nocturnal hypervigilance, instill a deep sense of safety, and create an inner guardian who takes over at night  
Duration: 18–20 minutes – Format: Slow, reassuring voice – Ambiance: Soft rain or crackling fire  
Structure:  
• Progressive induction centered on releasing automatic thoughts  
• Metaphor of a benevolent watcher: an inner presence stands guard so the mind can rest  
• Final anchor: each breath becomes a key that closes a mental door until morning  

Progress Indicators  
• Week 1: Track frequency and intensity of awakenings (scale from 0 to 5)  
• Week 2: Integrate sensory anchor + evaluate nighttime anxiety level  
• Week 3: Signs of stabilization in sleep phases, beginning of rest revaluation  
• Week 4: Reduced awakenings (1–2 max), noticeable evening calmness
