  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 42-year-old man experiencing intense emotional distress linked to unresolved trauma from past incidents involving violence, crime, and loss. He reports a heightened sense of insecurity, both physical and emotional, stemming from multiple experiences with violence involving close friends. Recurrent dreams of being chased and pursued evoke strong feelings of fear and powerlessness, suggesting unresolved traumatic memories. Additionally, the patient expresses persistent feelings of guilt and unresolved anger related to the loss of his sister and his perceived inability to act or express himself during critical moments. These dynamics manifest as intrusive thoughts, emotional volatility, and sleep disturbances characterized by vivid, unsettling dreams.",
