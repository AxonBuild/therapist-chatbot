  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient presents with significant emotional distress linked to the discovery of their partner's infidelity. They describe a profound sense of betrayal, confusion, and self-blame, with persistent feelings of a 'knot in the throat' associated with the traumatic moment of discovering the betrayal. Despite attempts to rationalize the event and move forward, they remain emotionally anchored to the shock of the discovery. They express difficulty processing the experience, oscillating between a desire to minimize the impact ('It's not a big deal, I should move on') and deeper feelings of unresolved emotional pain.",
