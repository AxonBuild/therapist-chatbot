  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 24-year-old man presenting with residual emotional distress linked to a past cancer diagnosis. During the session, he expressed difficulty in identifying specific emotional responses to the initial diagnosis, noting that much of the experience feels like a blur. He recalls feeling more impacted by moments of isolation at the hospital rather than the diagnosis itself. He exhibits a tendency to minimize the emotional impact of the event, framing it as 'just another chapter,' despite acknowledging residual emotional discomfort. The session aimed to explore emotional imprints left by these memories and identify potential unprocessed experiences.",
