  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 45-year-old man currently undergoing psychological support following a recent divorce after several years of relational ambivalence. He is a highly committed father, actively involved in his children's lives, particularly in supporting his younger son's competitive skiing. He demonstrates an internal conflict between emotional attachment to his ex-wife and the emergence of a new, promising romantic relationship. The patient expresses fatigue, nostalgia for the family unit, and struggles to fully detach emotionally from his former partner, despite a separation that was already emotionally effective for three years. Family tensions and betrayal experiences, particularly with his sister over inheritance matters, have reactivated childhood wounds and reinforced transgenerational patterns of emotional injustice. Nevertheless, he shows reflective capacity, self-awareness, and a clear commitment to not reproducing the dysfunctions of his paternal lineage.",
