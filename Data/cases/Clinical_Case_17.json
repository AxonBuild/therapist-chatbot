  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThis patient presents with chronic anxiety centered on protecting her children, particularly her daughter, from imagined threats. Although no objective evidence supports her fears, intrusive thoughts and catastrophic interpretations dominate her emotional responses. Episodes of hypervigilance are intensified by fatigue and stress, leading to compulsive questioning of her daughter and emotional flooding. She oscillates between moments of affection and disconnection with her partner, and often questions her own maternal capacity. Her internal conflict stems from unresolved personal trauma, emotional projections, and an overwhelming sense of responsibility.",
