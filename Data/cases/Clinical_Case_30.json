  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThis 46-year-old man is currently navigating a significant transitional period post-divorce. He demonstrates high emotional awareness, a strong paternal commitment, and a desire to break free from dysfunctional family patterns, particularly those rooted in paternal alcohol abuse and emotional neglect. Despite maintaining professional stability and engaging in a promising new romantic relationship, he experiences emotional fatigue, unresolved grief, and recurring conflict with his sister surrounding financial inheritance and fairness. The patient also expresses a continued emotional attachment to his ex-wife, as well as concerns about the psychological wellbeing of his children during the separation. His current therapeutic motivation centers on ensuring he does not replicate past familial traumas, emotionally supporting his children, and maintaining integrity in his evolving identity as a separated father.",
