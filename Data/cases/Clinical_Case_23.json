  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient, a 74-year-old woman, experienced an unexplained nocturnal fall on January 7, leading to facial trauma, bruises, and a period of confusion. Despite thorough medical evaluation including blood tests, imaging, and consultations, no clear etiology was confirmed. Current hypotheses suggest a vagal malaise or potential medication error (double intake of migraine medication), worsened by chronic hypotension and anemia. The patient remains emotionally shaken and physically weakened by the event. Post-event symptoms included transient nausea, disorientation, and a profound fatigue which continues to impair her daily function. She is undergoing regular hematologic monitoring and adjusting to a new baseline of reduced energy.",

Every day, even through fatigue, your presence and clarity grow. This path is not one of fragility, but of rediscovery. You are reclaiming safety not only in your home, but within yourself.
