  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe mother reports concerns about her son Maxime's progress at school, especially in French language skills. Despite attending French school since kindergarten and receiving additional tutoring, he remains significantly behind his peers. He excels in math and chess, but struggles in subjects related to language and expression. The school has not communicated these concerns earlier, and now suggests the possibility of repeating the year. The mother feels frustrated and unsupported by the school system, as her requests for additional materials and reading lists have been ignored. Maxime is described as socially withdrawn at school, possibly due to his perceived linguistic shortcomings. He currently practices individual sports (boxing, tennis, swimming), but lacks a team-based activity. A new multisport collective activity has been introduced, which may help support his socialization.",
