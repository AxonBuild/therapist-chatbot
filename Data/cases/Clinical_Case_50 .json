  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThis woman, a mother of three, presents with death anxiety reactivated through intergenerational transmission, particularly centered around her mother's comments about death and her grandmother's passing. Somatic hypervigilance has developed, characterized by obsessive body monitoring and catastrophic interpretations of benign sensations (e.g., dizziness perceived as a serious illness). Her emotional expression is blocked, leading to internalized fear and guilt, with difficulty verbalizing her concerns. Avoidance behaviors are notable, such as refusal to take medication due to fear of side effects, indicating a need for control to prevent perceived physical collapse.",
