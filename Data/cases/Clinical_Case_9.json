  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient, a 26-year-old woman, presents with a recurring pattern of emotional fusion in romantic relationships, marked by a strong need for validation and attention. Despite a recent period of emotional stability and newfound independence, she expresses significant nostalgia and sadness when reflecting on her childhood, particularly around familial gatherings and the loss of her grandfather. She reports difficulty maintaining boundaries in relationships, often feeling compelled to adapt to her partner's needs and suppress her own desires. Her current emotional state is characterized by ambivalence between desiring connection and fearing emotional dependence. She also experiences heightened sensitivity to rejection, a tendency to over-adapt to others, and a persistent feeling of emotional isolation, despite maintaining a relatively active social life. Additionally, she exhibits dissociative tendencies when recalling childhood memories, suggesting unresolved emotional trauma and a disrupted connection to her emotional core.",
