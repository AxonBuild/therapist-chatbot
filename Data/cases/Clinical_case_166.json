She reports pervasive feelings of being the 'black sheep' within her family, feeling persistently rejected by her mother, while her sister was perceived as the favored child.

These unresolved emotional conflicts have manifested in chronic pain, psychosomatic symptoms, and a deep sense of emotional exhaustion.",
