She expresses a profound sense of meaninglessness, compounded by medication mismanagement and fluctuating adherence to psychiatric treatment. The patient reports a lack of motivation, persistent anhedonia, and increased substance use as a coping mechanism. The patient also exhibits a pattern of emotional dissociation, reflecting a potential undiagnosed ADHD or HPE. Interactions with her mother have resurfaced unresolved conflicts, contributing to heightened emotional distress and increased substance consumption.",
