  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 26-year-old man who recently ended a manipulative romantic relationship marked by emotional control, guilt-tripping, and threats of self-harm from his partner. He demonstrates significant progress in asserting boundaries and regaining autonomy. However, the separation has reactivated deep-seated emotional issues, including abandonment fears and sensitivity to childhood symbols such as plush toys, which trigger strong emotional responses. Discussions with his parents have opened space for reprocessing family dynamics and feelings of past loneliness. He reports a persistent sense of emptiness, difficulty motivating himself to engage in tasks, and alternating phases of intense affect and emotional shutdown. His insight into relational patterns and his willingness to explore these themes is strong, allowing for focused therapeutic work.",
