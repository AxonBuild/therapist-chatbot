  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThis 63-year-old woman presents with longstanding emotional wounds related to maternal rejection and invalidation. Despite cognitive awareness of her mother's limitations in providing emotional support, she continues to seek validation from someone incapable of giving it, leading to repeated feelings of disappointment, frustration, and unresolved anger. The patient expresses a cycle of reactivation of past wounds each time she interacts with her mother, reinforcing her sense of being unworthy of love and emotional presence. Additionally, there are significant existential reflections on self-worth, the nature of reality, and finding meaning amidst perceived emptiness and emotional neglect.",
