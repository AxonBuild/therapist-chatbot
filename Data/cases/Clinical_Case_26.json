  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 54-year-old woman presenting with emotional exhaustion and relational confusion following a conflict with her partner on her birthday. The episode revealed longstanding relational ambivalence, difficulty expressing needs, and a recurring sense of injustice and rejection. She oscillates between deep emotional attachment and doubts about the legitimacy of the relationship. She reports disrupted sleep, fatigue, and difficulty resuming physical activity since returning from a trip abroad. Despite positive moments in the relationship, the conflict reactivated vulnerability tied to past wounds, including feelings of devaluation and lack of self-prioritization.",
