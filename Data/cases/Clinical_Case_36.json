  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient, a 49-year-old woman, presents a complex emotional profile shaped by early trauma, unresolved guilt related to past abortions, and a recurring pattern of affective dependency in romantic relationships. She reports a lifelong tendency to engage in relationships with unavailable men, often older and married, in what appears to be an unconscious attempt to be 'chosen' and to prove her worth. This behavioral pattern is likely linked to childhood experiences, including early maternal absence and perceived favoritism toward her younger brother. Additionally, the patient exhibits performance-related anxiety and somatic manifestations (tachycardia, intrusive thoughts), and signs of dissociation surrounding a past non-consensual sexual experience. She remains cognitively aware of her self-sabotaging mechanisms but feels unable to break free from them. Her emotional states fluctuate between guilt, shame, and a compulsive need for validation, especially when abandoned. Despite notable insight and resilience, she appears trapped in a loop of emotional reenactment and relational insecurity.",
