  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 45-year-old woman experiencing intense emotional fluctuations related to hormonal imbalances. She reports recurring episodes of emotional volatility, feelings of loneliness, and suppressed anger, particularly during hormonal cycles. Despite recognizing her need for emotional support and comfort, she struggles to verbalize it clearly, often defaulting to self-blame and frustration. Additionally, she expresses persistent feelings of emotional neglect stemming from childhood, where her attempts to express distress were dismissed or invalidated by her father and other authority figures. These dynamics have contributed to her current pattern of emotional isolation and a tendency to self-regulate without seeking support.",
