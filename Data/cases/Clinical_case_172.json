  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient presents with complex family dynamics involving her ex-husband and their two daughters, Margot and Ninon. Following a contentious separation, the patient took legal action to secure visitation rights for her daughters, attempting to maintain a connection between them and their father. Despite her efforts, the father remained emotionally distant, leading to lasting emotional repercussions, particularly for Margot, the elder daughter.\n\nMargot exhibits signs of fractured identity and unresolved abandonment, repeatedly seeking validation from her father despite recurrent disappointments. This has manifested in her adult life through unstable romantic relationships and a pattern of seeking control to mitigate feelings of rejection. Ninon, the younger daughter, appears more stable, having developed a more consistent identity and emotional resilience.\n\nThe patient also demonstrates signs of emotional depletion and self-neglect, having dedicated herself to her daughters' well-being while minimizing her own needs. She expresses frustration regarding her perceived invisibility and the lack of acknowledgment for her efforts as a single mother.",
