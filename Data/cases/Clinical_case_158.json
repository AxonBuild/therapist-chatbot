  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 38-year-old woman who expresses frustration and disillusionment with societal norms and cultural differences. She reports feeling increasingly detached from the French work ethic and lifestyle, contrasting it with her experiences in the United States. Professionally, she is content with her current role, having found stability and a balanced work schedule. Emotionally, she appears to be in a reflective phase, considering the impact of freezing her eggs as a precautionary measure given her declining ovarian reserve. Despite her professional satisfaction, she reports lingering discontent with her dating life, feeling disconnected and unmotivated to pursue new connections. She also expresses concern regarding the financial burden of potential fertility treatments and the broader implications of the French healthcare system.",
