  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThis 51-year-old woman presents with an invisible emotional exhaustion despite visible efforts and success in health-related goals (10 kg weight loss, regular physiotherapy, structured self-discipline). She expresses persistent self-judgment, dissatisfaction, and guilt over feeling emotionally overwhelmed despite a \"good life.\" Sleep is disturbed, and intrusive thoughts dominate her nights. She minimizes her needs and internalizes others' expectations, leading to isolation and shame when receiving no emotional reciprocity. Emotional suppression, self-disqualification, and somatized anxiety are central features. She exhibits fear of aging, self-sabotaging perfectionism, and an unresolved sense of illegitimacy in her suffering.",
