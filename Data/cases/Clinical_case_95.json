  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 67-year-old woman presenting with heightened emotional fragility, particularly in response to the decline and eventual death of her mother. She expresses concerns about her own cognitive health, fearing she may develop Alzheimer's disease despite reassurances to the contrary. Her mother was diagnosed with a dementia of the Alzheimer type (DTA), not Alzheimer's itself, but the patient remains fixated on the possibility of inheriting a similar condition. Additionally, she reports fluctuating emotional states, characterized by moments of intense sadness and apathy, followed by periods of relative stability. She expresses guilt over past conflicts with her mother and apprehension about becoming a burden to her own daughter.",
