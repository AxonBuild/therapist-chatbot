  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThis 9-year-old boy presents with school-related emotional distress rooted in repeated bullying episodes and a punitive, inconsistent response from school staff. He has been physically and verbally targeted by a small group of classmates, leading to a chronic sense of vulnerability and injustice. Although he maintains a close and meaningful friendship with one peer, this positive bond is strained by his fear of being forced to leave the school, creating a conflict between emotional security and personal safety. His narratives reveal a deep mistrust in adults, especially authority figures who fail to intervene reliably. Simultaneously, the child reports a strong phobia of spiders, which appears to symbolically express his internalized fears, lack of control, and helplessness. His emotional expression remains relatively contained, possibly due to fear of negative consequences or a learned strategy of silence. He shows signs of emotional inhibition, loyalty conflict (stay with friend vs. escape danger), and phobic somatization.",
