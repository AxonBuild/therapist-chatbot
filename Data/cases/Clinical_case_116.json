  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient, a 25-year-old man, presents with unresolved grief linked to the loss of his mother and grandmother, who were the primary sources of emotional validation in his life. He reports struggling to find a sense of self-worth and recognition in the absence of these key figures. Despite occasional gestures of appreciation from others, he remains unable to internalize positive affirmations and continues to feel unseen and undervalued. Sessions reveal emotional exhaustion stemming from repeated emotional flooding when recalling memories of his mother, particularly during her illness and his efforts to share significant life events with her.",
