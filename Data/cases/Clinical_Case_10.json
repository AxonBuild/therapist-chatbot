  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient, a 42-year-old woman, is currently experiencing emotional turmoil related to multiple stressors. She recently purchased a house that is causing significant frustration due to unresolved construction and regulatory issues. There is a sense of injustice and powerlessness regarding denied permits and inconsistent regulations, intensifying feelings of frustration and perceived unfairness.\n\nIn addition to these environmental stressors, the patient is also navigating the emotional aftermath of her father's death. She has been involved in sorting and clearing his belongings, a process that has proven to be emotionally taxing. Certain personal items, such as watches and glasses, have triggered intense emotional responses, while other items, such as furniture, have been easier to part with by donating them to a close friend.\n\nShe expresses a mix of anger and sadness towards her father, recalling that he passed away harboring unresolved resentment and bitterness. She notes a sense of irony in his ashes being placed in an urn that he did not choose, as a symbolic reflection of the unfulfilled closure in their relationship. Additionally, she struggles with maintaining emotional connection with her partner amidst these stressors, feeling emotionally drained and disconnected.",
