  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 45-year-old man experiencing difficulties with alcohol consumption, characterized by ritualistic drinking behaviors and difficulty managing consumption at home. He reports using alcohol as a coping mechanism while engaging in leisure activities such as watching Netflix or playing video games. The patient has successfully reduced his intake from 4-5 glasses per evening to approximately 2, facilitated by structured drinking rituals and the implementation of specific behavioral strategies such as changing the type of glass to disrupt habitual associations. Additionally, the patient expresses underlying feelings of inadequacy and a persistent belief of 'not being enough,' which may contribute to his reliance on alcohol as an emotional escape.",
