  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 28-year-old woman presenting with emotional overload and difficulty regulating her emotional responses. She reports a significant increase in irritability and emotional reactivity, primarily triggered by perceived lack of support from her partner and the stress of balancing work, motherhood, and personal expectations. Her emotional state is compounded by unresolved grief from a previous pregnancy loss and the traumatic experience of a high-risk pregnancy resulting in severe physical and emotional exhaustion. Despite maintaining a functional facade at work, she experiences emotional outbursts at home, particularly toward her partner, and struggles to decompress after intense emotional spikes.",
