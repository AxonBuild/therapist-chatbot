  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient presents with pronounced financial stress and existential distress following the unexpected job loss of her partner, Antoine, and the denial of a significant financial compensation they were relying on. This unexpected financial setback has intensified her underlying feelings of insecurity, helplessness, and fear of the future. \n\n    Additionally, the patient expresses frustration and confusion after a challenging social interaction in a professional context, where her values and beliefs were indirectly questioned. This experience exacerbated her sense of disconnection, self-doubt, and perceived inadequacy.\n\n    Furthermore, the patient reports deep existential despair and hopelessness linked to reproductive trauma, including multiple late-term terminations and the perceived loss of maternal identity. She describes moments of suicidal ideation and an intense desire for escape, feeling as though she is trapped in a life without direction or purpose.",
