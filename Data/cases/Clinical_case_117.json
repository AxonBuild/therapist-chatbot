  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient, a 25-year-old man, presents with profound feelings of emptiness and loss of purpose following the death of his mother and grandmother, who were the primary sources of validation and emotional support in his life. He reports a persistent struggle to feel recognized and valued, both in personal and social contexts. Despite receiving occasional positive feedback, he remains unable to internalize these affirmations and continues to experience a deep sense of insignificance and lack of direction. Additionally, he describes moments of emotional flooding when recalling his mother, particularly around the time of her illness and his attempts to share his life with her before her passing.",
