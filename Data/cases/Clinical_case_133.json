Despite attempting to set boundaries regarding contact with her in-laws, she reports ongoing feelings of betrayal and a profound loss of trust after her husband allowed his father into their home against her explicit wishes. Additionally, she struggles with feelings of guilt and ambiguity about maintaining or severing connections with certain family members, particularly her brother-in-law, as upcoming family events create pressure to reconcile.
