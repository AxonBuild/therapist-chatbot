  "main_issues": [
    "- Chronic sleep-onset insomnia (average latency > 90 minutes)",
    "- Cognitive hyperarousal at bedtime with rumination and mental overactivity",
    "- High mental load related to work and family responsibilities",
    "- Negative conditioning: bed = sleep struggle and failure",
    "- Absence of calming evening rituals",
    "- High sensitivity to nocturnal stimuli (sounds, light, internal tension)"
  ],
  "emotions": [
    "Frustration and irritability",
    "Anticipatory anxiety regarding sleep and next day performance",
    "Guilt for not 'succeeding in sleeping'",
    "Sense of failure",
    "Physical tension localized in the epigastric area and trapezius"
  ],
  "limiting_beliefs": [
    "- 'If I don't sleep, I'll ruin my day tomorrow.'",
    "- 'I must control my sleep.'",
    "- 'Falling asleep is a test I must pass.'"
  ],
  "therapeutic_goals": [
    "- Reduce cognitive hyperarousal and reframe sleep as a natural, non-pressured state",
    "- Recondition the bed as a safe, neutral space rather than a place of struggle",
    "- Develop calming evening rituals to ease the transition to sleep",
    "- Introduce sensory and emotional anchors to lower arousal levels",
    "- Reframe sleep-related beliefs to reduce anticipatory anxiety"
  ],
  "solutions": {
    "immediate": [
      "- Cognitive offloading exercise: write intrusive thoughts in a notebook before bed",
      "- Transition ritual: 30 minutes of dim light + calming, non-digital activity",
      "- 4-7-8 breathing technique to slow the heart rate and activate parasympathetic relaxation",
      "- Body scan focused on tension zones (jaw, solar plexus, shoulders)",
      "- Practice allowing wakefulness without resistance: 'It's okay to be awake right now.'"
    ],
    "intermediate": [
      "- Bed reconditioning: only stay in bed if sleepy. If not, get up for 10 minutes, then return",
      "- 'Paradoxical intention': consciously say 'I will stay awake' to reduce pressure to sleep",
      "- Visualization of a safe haven associated with relaxation and safety",
      "- White noise or binaural sounds to reduce auditory hypervigilance"
    ],
    "long_term": [
      "- Hypnosis theme: Reframing Sleep as a State of Natural Release",
      "- Dissociating bed from sleep struggle and reframing it as a safe space",
      "- Anchoring a calming word to signal the mind and body to release tension",
      "- Establishing a ritual of internal release before sleep to 'leave the day behind'"
