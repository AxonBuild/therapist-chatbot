  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient, a 10-year-old girl, presents with emotional sensitivity related to her parents' separation and perceived inconsistency in her father's behavior. She reports feeling a sense of abandonment when her father is emotionally distant and experiences a reactivation of early childhood memories when both parents are together. She expresses confusion and sadness regarding her father's unpredictable presence, particularly when he is less affectionate or fails to follow through on commitments. Physical symptoms include throat constriction and a sense of unease when reflecting on times she was unable to reach her mother, potentially amplifying the sensation of being left behind.",
