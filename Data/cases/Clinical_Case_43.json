  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThis 40-year-old woman working in the restaurant industry presents with agoraphobia combined with obsessive-compulsive features.

  "main_issues": [
    "- Agoraphobia with obsessive-compulsive components (fear of being trapped, impulse phobia)",
    "- Panic disorder with somatic symptoms (spasmophilia, dizziness, hyperventilation)",
    "- Cumulative trauma with unresolved emotional anchors (highway, father's death, brother's stroke)",
    "- Emotional exhaustion due to the 'family pillar' role and hyper-responsibility",
    "- Repeatedly disappointing therapeutic experiences leading to self-blame and frustration"

  "therapeutic_goals": [
    "- Reduce panic response and emotional reactivity to perceived 'trapping' situations",
    "- Reframe the highway memory as a context that no longer holds power over her",
    "- Re-anchor a sense of internal safety even in uncontrollable contexts",
    "- Establish boundaries between her responsibilities and her personal needs",
    "- Normalize the need for self-compassion without reinforcing guilt"

    "immediate": [
      "- Conscious breathing with sensory anchoring (visual, tactile, auditory cues)",
      "- Emotional journal to assess anxiety levels morning and evening",
      "- Gradual reintroduction to avoided contexts with controlled exposure techniques"
    ],
    "intermediate": [
      "- Cognitive restructuring of control beliefs ('I can manage discomfort without controlling everything')",
      "- Visualization exercises with escape options to diffuse rigid mental scenarios",
      "- Developing a 'Safe Space' visualization for use during panic episodes"
    ],
    "long_term": [
      "- Hypnosis theme: Releasing Control and Anchoring Inner Safety",
      "- Dissociate intrusive thoughts from emotional response",
      "- Reframe the highway as a symbol of fluidity and inner trust",
      "- Install a calm anchor for real-life use when anxiety arises"
