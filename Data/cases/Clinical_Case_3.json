  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 45-year-old woman presenting with pervasive self-judgment and unresolved feelings of shame related to past perceived inadequacies. She reports experiencing intrusive memories and flashbacks of situations where she felt inadequate or judged by others, primarily linked to her perceived lack of structure and cleanliness during adolescence. These memories are exacerbated by her current attempts to maintain a strict standard of order and control in her life, particularly as a mother and wife. Despite her conscious efforts to dissociate from her childhood patterns, she continues to feel haunted by lingering feelings of shame, self-blame, and unworthiness.",
