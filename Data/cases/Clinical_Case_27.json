  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman experiencing significant emotional distress related to unresolved family conflict following her mother's death. She is actively involved in legal and administrative battles to protect her father's interests, facing obstacles from the judiciary and family members, especially her brother. These difficulties have stirred intense feelings of injustice, guilt, and resentment, preventing her from progressing through the grieving process for her mother. Somatic symptoms such as throat tightness and chest pressure are recurrent, pointing to psychosomatic stress responses. Despite being emotionally overwhelmed, the patient continues to fight for what she perceives as justice, while simultaneously struggling with the complexity of her mixed emotions toward her deceased mother.",
