  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 68-year-old woman presenting with long-standing emotional fatigue and disrupted circadian rhythm. She reports a significant decrease in morning anxiety since the last session, but continues to struggle with motivation to get out of bed. Her emotional state is impacted by unresolved tensions with her partner's daughter, whom she perceives as manipulative and controlling. This dynamic reinforces a sense of injustice, emotional invisibility, and disempowerment in the household. Additional complaints include sleep disruption, gastric tension, and low energy, all of which contribute to her experience of chronic exhaustion.",
