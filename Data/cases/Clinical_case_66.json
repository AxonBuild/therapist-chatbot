A delay in receiving these results, coupled with perceived dismissal by medical staff, has exacerbated feelings of being overlooked and dismissed. Additionally, the patient reports experiencing ongoing difficulties in prioritizing her own needs over family responsibilities, leading to self-neglect. Recent conversations regarding her daughter Lola and her interactions with the therapist have highlighted a focus on superficial topics, which the patient interprets as a sign of emotional avoidance or superficial coping mechanisms.",
