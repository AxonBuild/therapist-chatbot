  "summary": "(RAG Format)\nThe patient is a 33-year-old man presenting with residual guilt and emotional distress linked to past infidelity and unresolved feelings toward his ex-wife. He reports ongoing emotional attachment to his ex-wife, which is complicated by the fact that he is now in a committed relationship with a male partner. Despite feeling more aligned sexually and emotionally with his current partner, he experiences intrusive memories and feelings of shame regarding his past behaviors, particularly during his ex-wife's hospitalization. He describes a period of compulsive sexual behavior and difficulty reconciling his actions with his current values, which has led to self-blame and a sense of internal conflict.",
