⸻

Age and Gender:
Female, approximately 40 years old (insomnia since age 25, for over 15 years).

⸻

Summary of Identified Issues:
1. Severe chronic insomnia (for over 15 years)
• Difficulty falling asleep or multiple nighttime awakenings.
• Deeply disrupted sleep pattern.
• Physical and mental exhaustion.
• High resistance to medication.

2. Anxious personality with ruminative tendencies
• Nighttime mental hyperactivity (existential reflections, nocturnal writing).
• Difficulty letting go and embracing mental stillness.

3. History of major relational trauma (abusive relationship)
• Experience of psychological, physical, and symbolic violence (confinement, arson, partner’s self-harm, isolation, implicit threats).
• Survival strategy through simulated submission (“pretending to be with him to get back to safety”).
• Post-traumatic symptoms: nocturnal visual hallucinations (arachnophobia/hypnagogic hallucinations), possible dissociative episode.

4. Unprocessed emotional burden
• Lack of external help at the time (isolation abroad).
• Feeling of having had to save herself alone.
• Trauma memory still very active.

⸻

Dominant Emotions:
• Deep fear (linked to the trauma).
• Extreme fatigue.
• Distress.
• Emotional loneliness.
• Ambivalence between lucidity and helplessness.
• Resilience and desire to heal.

⸻

Identified Limiting Beliefs:
• “I’m resistant to medication, so nothing can help me.”
• “I have to stay strong, alone, and endure.”
• “My anxiety is part of me, I’ll never be able to change it.”
• “I can’t trust my own body / night is the enemy.”

⸻

Main Emotional Triggers:
• Nighttime silence and inactivity = trigger for rumination.
• Prolonged solitude.
• Any situation perceived as loss of control.
• Unconscious resonance of traumatic episodes (e.g., confinement, helplessness).

⸻

Underlying Psychological Mechanisms:
• Post-traumatic hypervigilance (body in constant alert mode).
• Anticipatory anxiety (fear of not sleeping, which prevents sleep).
• Sensory emotional memory (linked to nighttime trauma).
• Difficulties in emotional regulation (writing and hypnosis used as partial self-regulation attempts).

⸻

Proposed Solutions:

1. Immediate solutions:
• Body grounding exercise to be done at the first signs of mental activation (e.g., lying body scan + 4-7-8 breathing).
• Targeted “emotional discharge” writing before bed to mentally offload worries.
• Implementation of a calming and stable evening ritual (soothing atmosphere, dim lighting, constant neutral sounds).
• Emergency session: hypnosis to deactivate ruminations (see below).

2. Intermediate solutions:
• Gradual work on the traumatic vigilance pattern (teaching the body to distinguish night from danger).
• Gentle body movements before bed (e.g., 10 minutes of slow stretching or self-massage).
• Guided visualization of safe places, anchored to a physical signal (e.g., hand placed on the chest).
• Start of a reeducation of the relationship to night through gentle desensitization (cognitive restructuring via hypnosis).

3. Long-term solutions:
• Immersive post-trauma hypnosis sessions (release of body-stored trauma memories).
• Work on limiting identity beliefs (e.g., “I’m broken” → “I survived, and I deserve rest”).
• Reconnection to the body through guided kinesthetic meditation.
• Trauma-focused therapy (EMDR or regressive hypnosis) if accepted later.

⸻

Tailored Hypnosis/Meditation Session (Initial Proposal):

Title: “Returning to Night as a Refuge”
Duration: 25–30 minutes
Goals:
• Reassociate night with a feeling of inner safety.
• Calm mental ruminations with positive and symbolic imagery.
• Gently reconcile the body with sleep.
Style: highly guided, slow and soothing voice, with soft sound ambiance (tropical forest at night or gentle water ripples).
Sensory anchoring: breathing at the sternum + visualization of a protective glowing cocoon.

⸻

Progress Tracking and Indicators:
• Before each session: rate level of fatigue and mental tension on a scale from 1 to 10.
• After each session: note whether falling asleep was easier, if intrusive thoughts decreased.
• Phase 1 Goal (weeks 1–3): reduce fear of night and of sleeplessness.
• Phase 2: stabilize physical and emotional recovery routines.
• Phase 3: deep restructuring of vigilance patterns.

Final Motivational Statement:
You survived the unbearable. What you’re looking for now isn’t a miracle, but a gentle release, an inner peace that is tamed slowly… night after night. Even if it’s just a spark, it’s already a fire in the making.
