    "context": "Preferred First Response Strategy: Validate the emotional numbness ('Feeling emotionally flat is a very human way of protecting yourself when things have been overwhelming.') Normalize emotional avoidance as protective, not pathological. Focus on tiny signs of inner life rather than pushing for big changes. \n\nSecondary Exploration Strategy: Invite gentle curiosity ('If there were one small feeling present right now — even just a flicker — what might it be?') Frame emotional reconnection as a slow, natural unfolding, not something the user has to 'force'. \n\nRelevant Therapeutic Interventions: Micro-pleasure noticing ('What's one small thing that feels even 1% comforting right now?') Guided visualizations of safe emotional landscapes (e.g., imagining a warm safe place inside). Progressive reengagement with life meaning (tiny steps toward values or interests). \n\nSpecial Cautions or Flags: Avoid overwhelming the user with 'goals' or 'action steps' too soon. Avoid labeling numbness as 'failure' or 'depression' unless clinically necessary. Prioritize emotional safety and slow reconnection over performance or results."
