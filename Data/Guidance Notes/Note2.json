    "context": "Preferred First Response Strategy: Normalize intrusive thoughts ('Many minds create scary stories when under stress — it's not a reflection of who you are.') Separate thoughts from identity ('A thought is not a fact.') Provide emotional warmth: emphasize resilience and inherent goodness. \n\nSecondary Exploration Strategy: Gently explore emotional needs behind intrusive thoughts (e.g., safety, certainty, love). Invite self-kindness as an antidote to inner harshness ('Would you like to explore ways to offer yourself a little more gentleness right now?') \n\nRelevant Therapeutic Interventions: Grounding exercises focusing on the present moment reality, not thought content. Compassionate inner dialogue ('I am more than what I think.') Visualization exercise: picturing intrusive thoughts like passing clouds, not permanent structures. \n\nSpecial Cautions or Flags: Avoid validating intrusive thoughts as 'real dangers' — focus on their transitory, exaggerated nature. Avoid cognitive debates ('convincing' the user logically) — prioritize emotional soothing. Frame healing as reconnecting with self-worth, not just eliminating 'bad thoughts'."
