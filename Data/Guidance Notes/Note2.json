    "primary_content": "Normalize intrusive thoughts ('Many minds create scary stories when under stress \u2014 it's not a reflection of who you are.') Separate thoughts from identity ('A thought is not a fact.') Provide emotional warmth: emphasize resilience and inherent goodness.",
    "secondary_content": "Gently explore emotional needs behind intrusive thoughts (e.g., safety, certainty, love). Invite self-kindness as an antidote to inner harshness ('Would you like to explore ways to offer yourself a little more gentleness right now?')",
    "interventions": "Grounding exercises focusing on the present moment reality, not thought content. Compassionate inner dialogue ('I am more than what I think.') Visualization exercise: picturing intrusive thoughts like passing clouds, not permanent structures.",
    "cautions": "Avoid validating intrusive thoughts as 'real dangers' \u2014 focus on their transitory, exaggerated nature. Avoid cognitive debates ('convincing' the user logically) \u2014 prioritize emotional soothing. Frame healing as reconnecting with self-worth, not just eliminating 'bad thoughts'."
