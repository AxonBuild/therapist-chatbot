    "primary_content": "Normalize bodily fear ('Your body is trying to protect you, even if it feels uncomfortable.') Immediate grounding through 5 senses (sight, sound, touch). Anchor the user's awareness gently to internal resources ('Your body knows how to come back to calm.')",
    "secondary_content": "If stabilized, softly explore whether fear arises more from: Fear of bodily collapse (internal focus) or Fear of external judgment (social focus). Affirm the user's historical strength ('You've already survived every wave of fear you've faced.')",
    "interventions": "'Safe zone' visualization exercise (imagining a calm, protected space). Progressive muscle relaxation (feet, hands, shoulders). Micro-exposure framing: imagine small, controlled steps outward if user expresses readiness.",
    "cautions": "Avoid suggesting rapid exposure ('Just go outside') unless user initiates desire. Avoid minimizing symptoms ('It's just anxiety') \u2014 validate the realness of sensations first. Emphasize stabilization and self-trust rebuilding before pushing expansion."
