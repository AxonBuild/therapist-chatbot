Intermediate solutions:\n   - Gradual work on the traumatic vigilance pattern (teaching the body to distinguish night from danger).\n   - Gentle body movements before bed (e.g., 10 minutes of slow stretching or self-massage).\n   - Guided visualization of safe places, anchored to a physical signal (e.g., hand placed on the chest).\n   - Start of a reeducation of the relationship to night through gentle desensitization (cognitive restructuring via hypnosis).\n\n3. Long-term solutions:\n   - Immersive post-trauma hypnosis sessions (release of body-stored trauma memories).\n   - Work on limiting identity beliefs (e.g., “I’m broken” → “I survived, and I deserve rest”).\n   - Reconnection to the body through guided kinesthetic meditation.\n   - Trauma-focused therapy (EMDR or regressive hypnosis) if accepted later.\n\n\n## Progress Indicato",
