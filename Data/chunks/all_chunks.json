She experiences a recurring fear of being found dead, alone, and without dignity. Additionally, the patient exhibits hyper-mentalization and difficulty accessing bodily sensations, remaining highly verbal but disconnected from her emotional experiences. There is an unresolved emotional imprint of grief following the loss of her husband during Covid, compounded by a lack of traditional mourning support.

He exhibits repressed explosive anger, as indicated by expressions of wanting to harm others or destroy objects. Feelings of disappointment and helplessness arise from losing control over his environment, leading to a sense of powerlessness. Conflicted sibling relationships contribute to his emotional state, marked by affective rivalry and difficulty in setting boundaries. The announcement of parental divorce has caused an emotional reaction primarily marked by shock, which requires further exploration. He shows a tendency to mentalize and rationalize his emotions, indicating possible emotional dissociation. Additionally, he is habituating to conflict, suggesting emotional exhaustion or apathy. This case appears to be related to emotion regulation.\n\n\n## Dominant Emotio",

Intermediate Solutions:  \n• Gradual social exposure work: 1 interaction/week with a non-familiar person (e.g., asking a question in a store).  \n• Cognitive reprogramming: actively reframe the belief “I’m dangerous” into “I’m vigilant precisely because I don’t want to harm.”  \n• Morning physical activation ritual: 10 minutes of walking or core exercises every morning to stimulate bodily anchoring.  \n\n3. Long-Term Solutions:  \n• Hypnosis focused on deactivating the “internal danger” schema  \n• Guided meditation to dissociate image/identity: “What I see does not define me”  \n• Progressive program for reinvestment in non-digital social activities  \n\n\n\n## Progress Indicato",

She feels she is wasting her intellectual potential on trivial cases and is disillusioned by the administrative shift in her profession.

The anxiety stems from a conflict between her originally invested professional identity and the current sense of absurdity. The patient exhibits emotional saturation, defensive hypersensitivity, affective ambivalence, and self-devaluation.
