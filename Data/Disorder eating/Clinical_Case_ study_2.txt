1️⃣ Identification & Structuring of Issues

Summary of main issues detected:
• Eating disorders at the end of the day (snacking or emotional eating episodes).
• Mental exhaustion caused by overload of responsibilities and lack of recognition.
• Harsh self-demand, with a constant pursuit of perfection and excellence.
• Rationalized emotional hypersensitivity, hidden under layers of control.
• Diffuse guilt, often used as a driver but ultimately draining.
• Sense of mismatch between effort invested and perceived results.
• Resistance to delegation despite fatigue, linked to high performance standards.
• Feeling of loneliness and intellectual disconnection.

Dominant emotions:
• Frustration
• Mental fatigue
• Repressed anger
• Guilt
• Doubt
• Sense of absurdity

Limiting beliefs identified:
• “I must be flawless to earn my place.”
• “If I don’t do it myself, it will be done poorly.”
• “Being sensitive means being weak.”
• “You can’t succeed without suffering.”

2️⃣ Trigger Analysis & Psychological Mechanisms

Chain reaction breakdown:
	1.	Accumulated fatigue + cognitive overload
	2.	Perceived lack of recognition / inefficiency of others
	3.	Activation of a control/duty schema → “I’ll do it myself”
	4.	Repressed emotional exhaustion → self-comfort through food
	5.	Post-behavior guilt → reinforcement of the cycle

Psychological and past origins:
• Inherited from a demanding parental model (present mother, absent or idealized father)
• Childhood marked by the need to excel to feel seen
• Intellectual rather than emotional rewards (value = performance)
• Retreat into rationalization to protect from emotion

3️⃣ Immersive Scenario & Emotional Anchoring

Imagine this familiar scene: the house is quiet. You’ve handled everything, turned off the screens, cleared the emails. And then, the calm sets in… and with it, an emptiness. A vague tension in the chest. No shouting, no conflict. Just a feeling of something left undone… or uselessness.
So, a little something sweet. Then another. And then… that look you give yourself: “Again.”
And the inner voice that judges: “That’s not worthy of you.”
It’s not hunger—it’s a call. An emotional call left unheard in the chaos of the day.

4️⃣ Proposed Solutions with Detailed Action Plan

Immediate solutions (to apply today):
• Set up an emotional transition ritual between work and evening (e.g.: hot shower + 3 minutes of cardiac coherence + anchoring phrase: “I’ve done enough for today.”)
• Keep a journal of emotional “saturations” at the end of the day → note what drained energy and why.
• Emotional rescue box: instead of compensating with food, create a sensory alternative (e.g., comforting warm drink, positive voice recording, weighted blanket).

Intermediate solutions:
• Recondition the link between worth and merit: begin to honor small daily wins (keep a list of “3 things I did well today”).
• Work on control schemas through cognitive coaching or ACT therapy.
• Restructure the day to include “emotional rewards” before the evening (exercise, chosen solitude, moments of pleasure without purpose).

Long-term solutions:
• Hypnosis to defuse the loop: fatigue → compensation → guilt → fatigue.
• Rebuilding a more fluid identity: less based on performance, more on authenticity.
• Meditation for accepting lack of control and vulnerability.

7️⃣ Final Motivational Phrase

“What if excellence no longer meant achieving everything, but daring sometimes to do nothing at all?
To dare being human—even when no box is checked.
Your value is not measured in results, but in presence.
And you are here.”
